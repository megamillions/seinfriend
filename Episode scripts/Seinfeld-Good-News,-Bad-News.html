</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, why we're here? To be out, 
               this is out...and out is one of the 
               single most enjoyable experiences of 
               life. People...did you ever hear people 
               talking about "We should go out"? This 
               is what they're talking about...this 
               whole thing, we're all out now, no one 
               is home. Not one person here is home, 
               we're all out! There are people tryin' 
               to find us, they don't know where we 
               are. (imitates one of these people "tryin' 
               to find us"; pretends his hand is a 
               phone) "Did you ring?, I can't find 
               him." (imitates other person on phone) 
               "Where did he go?" (the first person 
               again) "He didn't tell me where he was 
               going". He must have gone out. You wanna 
               go out: you get ready, you pick out 
               the clothes, right? You take the shower, 
               you get all ready, get the cash, get 
               your friends, the car, the spot, the 
               reservation...There you're staring around, 
               whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be 
               getting back". Once you're out, you 
               wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, 
               you wanna get up, you wanna go out again 
               tomorrow, right? Where ever you are 
               in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta 
               go.

</b>               Seems to me, that button is in the worst 
               possible spot. (talking about George's 
               shirt) The second button literally makes 
               or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's 
               too high! It's in no-man's-land, you 
               look like you live with your mother.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't 
               actually recall considering the buttons.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (pretends he's talking into a microphone) 
               Uh, no, not at this time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, senator, I just like to know, 
               what you knew and when you knew it. 
               (a waitress approaches the table)
<b>

               his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants 
               to pour coffee, but George stops her)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               the orange indicator?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               It's missing, I have to do it in my 
               head: decaf left, regular right, decaf 
               left, regular right...it's very challenging 
               work. (ironically)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, 
               Claire is a professional waitress.

               and uh...the conversation though, I 
               mean, it was...talking with her is like 
               talking with you, but, ya know, obviously 
               much better.

               is their only chance to escape and they 
               all know it. They knew a escape from 
               the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, 
               the night before: (sock's voice) "Tomorrow, 
               the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" 
               The dryer-door swings open and the sock 
               is waiting up against the side wall. 
               They hope you don't see him and then 
               he goes down the road (shows how the 
               sock is going down the road). They got 
               buttons sewed on their faces: join the 
               puppet show...So they're showing me 
               on television the detergent for getting 
               out blood-stains...Is this a violent 
               image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, 
               I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains

               Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't 
               understand the name; maybe "Kramer" 
               wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!) 
               I taped the game, it's one o'clock in

               and tears it out. Jerry looks at him 
               with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look"

               later, they're out, they're gone, the, 
               the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, 
               ladies? What are you doin' with them? 
               The only time I ever see'em is in the 
               bottom of your little waste basket, 
               there's two or three, that look like 
               they've been through some horrible experience... 
               tortured, interrogated, I don't know 
               what happened to them...I once went 
               out with a girl who's left a little 
               zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over 
               my house. I don't know what to do with 
               them, I took them out, I put them on 
               my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. 
               I thought maybe the cockroaches would 
               see it, figure this is a dead town: 
               "Let's move on"... The dating world 
               is a world of pressure. Let's face it: 
               a date is a job-interview, that lasts 
               all night. The only difference between 
               a date and a job-interview is: not many 
               job-interviews is there a chance you'll 
               end up naked at the end of it...ya know: 
               "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're 
               the man for the position, why don't 
               you strip down and meet some of the 
               people you'll be workin' with?".

               they do is subtle...men are not subtle, 
               we are obvious. Women know what men

               really is: we want women. How do we 
               get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, 
               we don't know. The next step after that 
               we have no idea. This is why you see 
               men honking car-horns, yelling from 
               construction sites. These are the best 
               ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, 
               is that a beauty? Have you seen men 
               doing this? What is this? The man is
