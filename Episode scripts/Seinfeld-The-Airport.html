</b>               ...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; 
               there's always a small problem "There'll 
               be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* 
               late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! 
               We're just trying to get one of those 
               *little* trucks to pull us up just a 
               *little* closer to the jetway so you 
               can walk down the narrow hallway and 
               there'll be a man there in a tight suit 
               and he'll tell you you have very little 
               time to make your connecting flight. 
               So move it!".
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Open with Jerry and Elaine in a car on their way to the airport. 
               Elaine is singing a poppy Jazz tune.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, 
               boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, could you do me a favour? (pause) 
               Could you shut-up?They both chortle, 
               and Jerry is hot so he's taking his 
               coat off, but Elaine refuses to take 
               the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck 
               and before you can say "Planes, Trains 
               and Automobiles", they collide head-on 
               with a Snapple truck....
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Would you believe a big purple jeep?

<b>               
</b>               Okay, they don't hit anything, but Jerry's hand *did* get stuck...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Anyhoots, Elaine goes to roll down the window, and...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey guess what? This window doesn't 
               work.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: 
               the window doesn't work,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (pause) Or is that you?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Gimme ten bucks and find out...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, this worked out pretty good. Them 
               givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you 
               get a free trip to St. Louis, I did 
               my gig, you got to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               see your sister...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, worked out good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And here's the beauty--

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George is pickin' us up at the airport.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know that awning outside my building?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He's always bragging about his vertical 
               leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that 
               he couldn't touch the awning.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So what happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He didn't come within two feet of the 
               thing. He's wavin at it...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't 
               have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to pay me anything.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, how we doin' on time?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, 
               pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk 
               right on the plane...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Oops.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey! Wait up!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             DRIVER
</b>               Sorry. Heh heh heh...

<b>               
</b>               The driver speeds away without our heroes, and he seems pretty 
               happy about it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Finally inside, they check their luggage...

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I confused it with another awning.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We're perfect. I timed this out so we 
               would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 
               17 minutes after their flight is supposed 
               to land. That gives them just enough 
               time to get off the plane, pick up their 
               bags and be walking *out* of the terminal 
               as we roll up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you

</b>               Where do I know that guy from?

<b>               
</b>               Back in the developing nation section of the plane (coach, that 
               is), Elaine is still pining for the guy next to her to wake up 
               so she can go to the bathroom.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (To herself, loudly) Wake up, you human 
               slug! Wake up! *Wake*
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! (To the slug out loud) Excuse 
               me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The cad has the nerve to look peeved, and Elaine has a hard time 
               getting out of her seat. She looks a little like Kramer stumbling 
               and falling into the aisle. The capper is that as she's getting 
               up, facing the row of seats (and their staring sitters) across 
               from her, Elaine makes faces at them like she's a homicidal maniac 
               from "Taxi Driver". You can just see the words "You lookin' at 
               *me*?" etched in her brain. It's a killer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Anyway, as Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia 
               are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.

</b>               Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside 
               to see if J+E are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer 
               in the car.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               The plane's been re-routed *back* to 
               Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- 
               it tolls for thee.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer peels out. He's on a mission from God.

               my personal favourite.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in 
               a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.

</b>               They do that "tink" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back 
               to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the

</b><b>                             PASSENGER 1
</b>               I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected

</b><b>                             PASSENGER 2

</b><b>                             PASSENGER 2

</b>               Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split 
               it with you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               How big of you, you brute. They board the plane.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               I dunno, George. Those *coach* bathrooms stink. Just ask Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard 
               doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then 
               again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying 
               in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the 
               plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom 
               door to a reply of "Just a minute" from the occupant inside (I 
               bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the 
               Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why 
               he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, 
               the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his 
               cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult 
               to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in 
               the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. 
               Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with 
               going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws 
               against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until 
               they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?

</b>               Excuse me... Excuuuse me...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.

</b>               What is your name?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Elaine Benes?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT
</b>               (Checks her list) You're going to have 
               to go back to coach.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, but there was nobody sitting here...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT
</b>               Yes, but you're still not allowed. These 
               seats are very expensive.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. 
               Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice 
               up here. It's so comfortable up here. 
               I don't want to go back there. Please 
               don't send me back there... (She notices 
               another attendant offering goods)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Oh, you got *cookies*!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT
</b>               You're going to have to go back to your 
               seat!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, 
               our goal should be a society *without* 
               *classes*! (She goes through the curtain 
               to,ick, *coach*) Do you realise that 
               the people up here are getting *cookies*!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket 
               and napping (at least, that's what I *think* they're doing under 
               that big, blue blanket...)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What is all the racket back there? You 
               know, you're trying to relax on the 
               plane and this is what you have to put 
               up with.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (To attendant) What is going on?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT
</b>               Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into 
               first class.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem 
               is, that curtain is no security-- there 
               really should be a locking door.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Electrified, with a moat if possible. They return to snuggling...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!

<b>               
</b>               No good. He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly 
               escapes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances 
               out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms 
               flailing out on the runway. He takes a second look, just to be 
               sure.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Couldn't be...

<b>               
</b>               After they get off the plane, J+E look for the boys and get their 
               baggage
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             
</b>               how would they know Kramer was there, 
               too? They didn't get a hold of George 
               on the phone, or he would've went to 
               Laguardia in the first
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               place...)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Where are they already? I don't see 
               them anywhere...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Well, George is being raped in a bathroom and Kramer is still 
               on the lam somewhere in the airport...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I got my bags, I'm ready to go.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...

<b>               
</b>               In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving 
               around the baggage thingy, complete with lei...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               The worst flight I have been on in my 
               entire life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, me too...

<b>               
</b>               He seems so sincere. Tia walks by, along with an entourage of 
               photographers.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TIA
</b>               I'll call you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay... (To a bamboozled Elaine) It's 
               a business thing...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out-- 
               you didn't expect a whole episode to go by without a "Kramer 
               entrance", did you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You guys ready?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Where's George?

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Well, you can't hear him through the window, but he is definitely 
               shouting
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               "KRAMER!"
</b>
<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But I have to admit, I like flying. 
               I like those little bathrooms that they 
               have on the plane. It's kind of like 
               a small apartment of your own on the 
               plane. You go in, you close the door, 
               the light comes on. It's like a small 
               surprise party every time you go in 
               there. The worst way of flying, I think 
               is "standby", you ever fly standby? 
               It never works, you know, that's why 
               they call it standby--
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you stand there going "Bye!" So I was on this flight where the 
               flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't 
               have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going 
               "Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?" It's 
               like, "Who the Hell are you?!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                              THE END
