<b>                          THE ALTERNATE SIDE
</b>


                             Written by

                     Larry David & Bill Masters




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the 
               car will behave as
<b> 
</b>               if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone 
               disturbs it,
<b> 
</b>               it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. 
               Not
<b> 
</b>               everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't 
               it be nice
<b> 
</b>               if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? 
               You know, somebody
<b> 
</b>               tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would 
               like a car alarm
<b> 
</b>               like that.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               First scene.

               Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Do you believe this? The car was parked 
               right out front.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Was the alarm on?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't 
               know my alarm sound; I'm not
<b> 
</b>               tuned in to it like it's my son.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't understand, how do these thieves 
               start the car?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They cross the wires or something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Cross the wires? I can't even make a 
               pot of spaghetti.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They stole my car.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Who did?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They did.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Was it more than just one?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What should I do, should I call the 
               police?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What are they gonna do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'd better call the car phone company, 
               cancel my service.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe you should call your car phone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, he's probably driving it right 
               now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wait a minute, call the car phone, see 
               what happens.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Are you serious?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, go ahead, call.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't even know if I remember the

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry dials.

               do you cross those wires?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAR THIEF
</b>               I didn't cross any wires, the keys were

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               I'm in awe of his intellect, when he

<b> 
</b>               kidding around, of course.

</b><b>                             AGENT

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I'll tell you, she would have

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               she'd be spinning.

<b>

</b><b>                             AGENT

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But the reservation keeps the car here. 
               That's why you have the

<b>               
</b><b>                             AGENT

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't think you do. If you did, I'd 
               have a car. See, you know how to
<b> 
</b>               take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation 
               and
<b> 
</b>               that's really the most important part of the reservation, the 
               holding. Anybody
<b> 
</b>               can just take them.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You 
               know what she's saying over there?
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you 
               start talking.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, you mean like this? So it looks

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               not really saying anything at all?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now you say something else and they 
               won't yell at me 'cause they thought
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I was checking with you.

<b> 
</b>               know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the 
               bar a really long
<b> 
</b>               time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman 
               and he's
<b> 
</b>               parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! 
               Alright!
<b> 
</b>               Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels 
               are making me

               filmmaker said

               bitch to get here.
<b> 
</b>               It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to
