<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's sitting at the table, reading the paper. George bursts 
               into the room)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving 
               out!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Gets up) Get out!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across 
               from mine, huh. I can't wait for you 
               to see it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Looks around his apartment) Is it better 
               than mine?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Definite) Oh yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know what? It's better than Elaine's, 
               too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves 
               tward the phone)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Stops) Oh right, the blind date.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up 
               now. I guess the blind people don't 
               like being associated with all those 
               losers.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Come on. Come check out my new place. 
               It'll take you two minutes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at 
               my mini-storage.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture 
               down there? I need some more stuff to 
               fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in 
               closet. (Smiles)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really 
               annoying.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Laughs as they leave) It's working

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry and Kramer both go up to a unit door. Kramer's pulling 
               a wagon full of junk. He starts to cough uncontrollably)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Disgusted) What is with that?!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells 
               the diseased germs out of the body, 
               into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs 
               being in the air)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Takes out his key to unlock the unit 
               door) Where is your key?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's 
               got it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, Kramer, I rented out half 
               of my space to you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, and I rented out half that space

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               (George is moving in. The place is bare. A woman walks in while 
               he's attempting to hang a lamp near the fire place)
<b>

               No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of 
               the tenant's association.
<b> 
</b><b>

               It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and 
               guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball)
               toward Mrs. Ricadi. She backs off defensively)
               Come on! (Stops and laughs right before running
               into her)

               unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 
               8C has decided that he wants the apartment.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             RICARDI
</b>               Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge 
               is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in 
               light of the terrible suffering that 
               he's already been through, we've decided 
               to give it to him.
