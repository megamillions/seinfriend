<b>                           THE APARTMENT
</b>


                             Written by

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I painted my apartment again. 
               I've been living in this apartment for 
               years and years, and every time I paint 
               it, it kinda gets me down. I look around,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I 
               realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of 
               it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the 
               wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two 
               slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug 
               in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on 
               the Starship Enterprise. You know what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star 
               Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through 
               space in your living room, watching
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because 
               Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday 
               night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               there.

<b>               
</b>               (Scene ends)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. 
               His hair is slicked down)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What did you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Mousse. I moussed up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I guess it was just a matter of time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know, I should've done this years 
               ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. 
               My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. 
               Hey, tell me the truth,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have you ever seen a better looking guy?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, look, its so subjective.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't mean to interrupt or anything, 
               but on Sunday, my friend is having a 
               brunch for the New York Marathon.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She lives right above First Avenue, 
               and says she has a perfect view of the 
               race. And she said I can invite some 
               friends.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe.

<b>               
</b>               (A loud argument erupts in the hallway between Harold and Manny, 
               the building supervisors)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams 
               out something in Spanish)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Harold and Manny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               I'm not going. (Manny says something 
               in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the 
               hall)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boys, boys.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Oh, Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I slid the rent under your door, Harold. 
               Did you get it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would 
               you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's 
               apartment? (Manny starts yelling at 
               Harold in Spanish) I was only
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               joking. (To Jerry) He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's 
               things. (Manny starts talking in Spanish) We have to go up there 
               now and clean the apartment.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there 
               for a month.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?

<b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. 
               She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MANNY

<b>

</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! 
               I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone 
               who needs an apartment?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Are you kidding? You know my friend

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Oh yeah, I like her. She always says 
               "hello" to me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause 
               she would take it in a second.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, 
               but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting 
               in Spanish) What's the difference? It's 
               true.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, it's okay? I could just tell her 
               she can have it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HAROLD
</b>               Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, 
               too. It's only four hundred dollars 
               a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. 
               (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.
<b> 
</b><b>

               at all last night.. I decided I have

               neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise 
               at three o' clock in the morning? I 
               mean, can you knock on someone's door               
               and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole 
               self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening 
               to me? Can I do this? Am I a               
               shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going 
               on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh..shh.... 
               shhh... shhh.. Doesn't work, 'cause               
               nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a Shh. 
               "Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me." Some people 
               you can't shush in a movie               
               theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it. 
               They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing 
               them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables.
