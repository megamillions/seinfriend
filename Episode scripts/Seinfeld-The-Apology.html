</b>               Any

               second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.

<b>                             MELISSA,
</b>               Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.

<b>                             JERRY,
</b>               How about that.

<b>                             MELISSA,
</b>               Mmm-hmm.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She ate breakfast naked?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               She didn't even want a napkin.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom 
               naked... I have never had living-room naked.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, it's a scene.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's like you're livin' in the Playboy 
               Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't really have enough room.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE,
</b>               Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey!

<b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Hi.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey.

<b>                             PUDDY,
</b>               I got to make a pit stop.

<b>                             ELAINE,
</b>               'Kay.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Back together?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               His apartment was being fumigated, 
               so we thought we'd give it 
               another shot.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah...

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So guess who called me last night? 
               Jason Hanke.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He called to apologize for standing 
               me up five years ago.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why now?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. 
               Step number Nine is you have to
<b> 
</b>               apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke 
               to come crawling back to me.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Still with the neck hole?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Still upset. Very upset.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What neck hole?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Remember that New Year's party he threw 
               a few years ago? He had that
<b> 
</b>               very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A cashmere sweater.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. 
               So in front of the whole
<b> 
</b>               party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck 
               hole.'
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody 
               else did!
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, it's funny. I mean, you have 
               a big head. Or is it 'cause of
<b> 
</b>               your neck?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I think the head does most of the 
               stretching.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Regardless. I had to walk around for 
               the rest of the party in some
<b> 
</b>               cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I really think it's the size of your 
               neck.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's my head!

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey.

<b>                             PEGGY
</b>               Hey.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Isn't this great? With those nerds 
               in accounting moved, you and I
<b> 
</b>               are the only ones who use this bathroom.

               (Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the 
               toilet)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You went to the coffee shop without 
               me? I told ya, I just wanted to
<b> 
</b>               hop in the shower.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               That was an hour ago. What were you 
               doing in there?
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Showering. How long does it take you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ten minutes.

<b>                             KRAMER,
</b>               Ten minutes? That's

               kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ten minutes.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Let me smell you.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               All right. Whiff away.

<b>                             KRAMER,
</b>               Uh... that's not bad at all.

<b>                             ELAINE,
</b>               Hup! That's it.

<b>                             KRAMER,
</b><b>               OK.
</b>
<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So get this. I'm in the bathroom at 
               work today, and I see Peggy
<b> 
</b>               using a seat protector.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               So?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So... we're the only women on the floor. 
               I mean, we're like
<b> 
</b>               roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a 
               roommate?
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY,
</b><b>               I
</b>
               think the damage is probably already done.

<b>                             JERRY,
</b>               All

               right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.

</b>               Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe 
               I can make some changes. Get

</b>               wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- 
               focus!

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I do not challenge.

<b>                             MELISSA

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't

<b> 
</b>               tiles.

<b>                             MELISSA

<b>                             JERRY

<b>                             MELISSA,
</b>               Wrong

               pipe.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE,
</b>               So she coughed.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, 
               man.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Everything goes with naked.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               When you cough, there are thousands 
               of unseen muscles that suddenly
<b> 
</b>               spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball 
               in his
<b> 
</b>               stomach in slow motion.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you 
               now how much mental energy I
<b> 
</b>               expend just trying to picture women naked?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               But the thing you don't realize is 
               that there's good naked and bad
<b> 
</b>               naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, 
               there's Hanke.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right. It's grovel time.

<b>                             HANKE
</b>               Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just 
               got sober, so I've been going
<b> 
</b>               through the Twelve Steps.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HANKE
</b>               Yeah. Making amends.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Important step. Maybe the most important.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HANKE
</b>               Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may 
               sound dumb, but, you know, when
<b> 
</b>               we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may 
               even have
<b> 
</b>               called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you 
               noticed, but I
<b> 
</b>               always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate 
               you rectifying it.
<b> 
</b><b>                             HANKE
</b>               (eyeing George, who's looking expectedly 
               up at him): Great. Great.
<b> 
</b>               Well, I'll see you guys later.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER,
</b>               Well, I just got out of a 27-minute
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. 
               Yeah, I
<b> 
</b>               think what I kept is even stronger now.

<b>                             JERRY,
</b>               You got some suds over here.

<b>                             KRAMER,
</b>               Wha...? Oh, man!

               Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me 
               what I'm doing
<b> 
</b>               wrong.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, come on!

<b>                             KRAMER

<b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER,

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY,
</b>               Now my sense of it is that you're probably
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then 
               another.
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, that's how cats do it.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               But, when you have a faucet instead 
               of a tongue, you want to use
<b> 
</b>               gravity.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               OK. Let's turn the water on now. 
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b>               was spotted taking personal inventory.

<b>                             JERRY

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All he has to do now is count his blessings, 
               say a prayer, and he's
<b> 
</b>               done. Do you believe this?

<b>                             KRAMER

<b>

<b>                             HANKE

<b>                             GEORGE

</b>               Well, technically he did apologize.

</b>               Jerry, I felt like a straight man in 
               some horrible sketch. He was
<b> 
</b>               riffing! Riffing! On my pain!

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               So now you want an apology for the 
               apology, plus the original
<b> 
</b>               apology?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's right. I'm two in the hole!

               Lady Godiva. She did a full body
<b> 
</b>               flex on a pickle jar.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Did you explain to her about the good 
               naked and the bad naked?

               huh? You still got that
<b>

<b>                             JERRY

               from!
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, 
               I'm trying to get out of the
<b> 
</b>               shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where 
               I want to
<b> 
</b>               be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, 
               and now I
<b> 
</b>               ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.

<b>                             JERRY

<b>                             KRAMER

</b>               She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering

<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>                             PETERMAN
</b>               I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's

<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, let me tell you something: this 
               is all in her mind, OK? She is
<b> 
</b>               insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, 
               rubbed
<b> 
</b>               her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, 
               she's a
<b> 
</b>               wacko.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE,

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned 
               about this guy.
<b> 
</b><b>                             SPONSOR
</b>               He's doing very well. He's already

<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, well when you don't actually 
               do the steps, you can go through
<b> 
</b>               them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.

<b>                             SPONSOR
</b>               Is there some unresolved issue between 
               you and Jason?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know. A little thing called 
               Step Nine? Instead of an
<b> 
</b>               apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.

<b>                             SPONSOR
</b>               I'm not sure what you want me to do.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, aren't you the boss of him? You 
               shouldn't let him move up!
<b> 
</b>               When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three 
               years 'cause
<b> 
</b>               I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.

<b>                             SPONSOR
</b>               You're quite upset, George.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I think you should drop him down 
               to Step Two.
<b> 
</b><b>                             SPONSOR

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
<b>

<b>                             GEORGE

<b>                             JERRY,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have

<b> 
</b><b>                             MELISSA

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>                             JERRY,

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, the female body is a... work 
               of art. The male body is
<b> 
</b>               utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.

<b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>                             PUDDY

               bring the man you're currently

</b>               I still have trouble looking at those

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, I've had those since college. 
               They're bunnies.
<b> 
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               They're bacteria traps.

               (as Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously 
               naked,
<b>

<b>                             KRAMER

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Insert a knife into the center and

<b> 
</b>               flexible. I just started yesterday.

<b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, 
               and you deserve

</b>               much better.

<b>                             HANKE

               want to get into a big thing
<b> 
</b>               here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said 
               was actually an
<b> 
</b>               apology.

<b>                             HANKE

               George, what are you talking

</b>               about?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it's just, all you said was 'your 
               welcome', which is nice.
<b> 
</b>               It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.

<b>                             KID

<b> 
</b>               have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, 
               I-I admitted I
<b> 
</b>               was wrong, so what more do you want from me?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I would like an apology.

<b>                             HANKE

               with someone here, if

               That's what I want! Now say it

<b>                             HANKE
