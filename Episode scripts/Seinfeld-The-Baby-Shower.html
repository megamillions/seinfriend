</b><b>               
</b>               (Night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Men flip around the television more 
               than women, I think. Men get that remote 
               control in their hands, they don't even 
               know what the hell they're watching.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. 
               " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." 
               "Who was that?" "I don't know what it
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, 
               I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will 
               stop and go, "Well, let me see what the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. 
               Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we 
               watch TV differently. Before
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               there was flipping around, before there was television, kings 
               and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would 
               tell them stories 'cause that was their
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, 
               like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip 
               around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to 
               the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in 
               that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut 
               up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want 
               to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               here. I'm going to bed."

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is 
               pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's the performance artist, right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. 
               She's a real performer. A real trooper.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's her husband's name, again? Chip? 
               Kip? Skip?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Todd.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went 
               to their wedding. You should have heard 
               him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying 
               to blame the whole thing on
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bad directions.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That woman was unequivocally the worst 
               date of my life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, pardon me for trying to set you 
               up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What, you don't think I can attract 
               beautiful, intelligent women?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Thin ice, George. Thin ice..

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance 
               piece she'll give birth on stage.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow 
               to the culture.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Gesturing to George) You believe this 
               guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She dragged me down to that warehouse 
               on the waterfront in Brooklin to see 
               one of her "performances".
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for 
               some celebrity?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's 
               yelling and screaming, and the next 
               thing I know, she throws a big can of 
               chocolate syrup all over my new red
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               shirt.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It was an accident!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She 
               was aiming right at me like she was 
               putting out a fire! Then, for the rest 
               of the show, I'm sitting there with 
               chocolate all
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing 
               all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, 
               backstage when I talk to her, I'm a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw 
               any other foods?"

               a shot.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And then, then, then she leaves with 
               somebody else! Never even, never even 
               said goodbye! Never called me back.. 
               Never apologized. Nothing. Like I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b>               What do you do at the end of a date 
               when you know you don't want to see 
               this person ever again, for the rest 
               of your life? What do you say? What 
               do you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. 
               See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you 
               around that area. You'll be around other
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take 
               care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. 
               Take care, now. Because, I'm
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, 
               now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" 
               Isn't that what you really want to say?
<b>

</b>               "Take off now."
