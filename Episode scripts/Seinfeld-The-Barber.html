</b><b>                             MR. TUTTLE
</b>               Well George we here at Sanalac like 
               to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive 
               company. We
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have a small but prestigious group of clients.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well a lot of people consider me small 
               and prestigious.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MR. TUTTLE
</b>               That's funny George. You're very quick. 
               I feel like I, like I don't have to 
               explain every little
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               thing to you. You understand everything immediately.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I enjoy understanding.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MR. TUTTLE
</b>               I want you to have this job. Of course...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SECRETARY
</b>               Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MR. TUTTLE
</b>               Thanks. I've got to take this call. 
               Listen, I'm really glad that you came 
               in.

</b>               At Monk's

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I want you to have this job. Of course...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What do you mean that's it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He never finished the sentence. He got 
               a call, that was the end of the interview.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "Of course" was the last thing he said?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe he was going to say "Of course 
               I have to check with my associates."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               "I want you to have this job, of course 
               the Board of Directors is under indictment 
               and will be
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               serving time."

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "I want you to have this job, of course 
               sodomy is a prerequisite."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why don't you go ahead and call him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Because he made a big deal about how 
               I understand everything immediately. 
               That's what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               impressed him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So if you call and ask if you have the 
               job, you might lose the job.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And if I don't call...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You might have the job, but you'll never 
               know it. What kind of company is it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Rest stop supply.

</b>               Kramer comes in and sits down.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh course. I wouldn't let that other

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I've been going with him for 12 
               years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his 
               feelings.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's 
               day off. Gino's there all by himself.
<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

               there and get one to look good for my 
               bachelor
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               auction.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with me for so long. You're so loyal.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I, if it's your day off I really...

</b><b>                             ENZO
</b>               (He pulls Jerry into the barber chair.

               Eh, what's the difference.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell 
               the joke, I cut the hair.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. 
               This is the best haircut I've ever had.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               At Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is sitting down on the couch with a really bad haircut. 
               He is holding a mirror. Jerry and George are
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               looking in disbelief at the haircut.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He massacred you. You look like you're 
               five years old.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo 
               helps.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You've got to start seeing someone else. 
               Get out of this relationship.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his 
               most loyal customer. Plus he's right 
               there on the corner. I'd
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have to pass him every day when I go by.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You gotta do it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

               not going to let
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No Kramer. I don't want you to do that.

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I show up. I pretend I have the job.

</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's 
               a big one down the hall there and a 
               small one over here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               You know I should ask Jack.

</b>               Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very 
               small apartment. I like to feel tucked 
               in, nestled in. Love
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to be nestled.

</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               All right, it's 808 right down there. 
               Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, 
               you can start working on that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b>               George walks into his office. He sets down his briefcase and 
               coat and sits down. He quickly flips through

</b><b>               
</b>               the folder, then drops the folder on his desk with a big thud.

</b><b>

</b>               Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your 
               file. I was transferring the contents 
               of the file into this

</b>               There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that

<b>               
</b>               Newman follows behind Jerry closely as Jerry goes to the kitchen.

<b>               
</b>               Newman tries again as Jerry goes to his couch. Newman follows

               hides the scissors. Jerry looks at Newman

</b>               confused.

<b>               
</b>               Newman reaches behind Jerry and get a snip of hair.

<b>

</b><b>                             TUTTLE
</b>               I though you would have taken the large 
               office.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh. Really.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TUTTLE
</b>               I guess I didn't make that clear when 
               I hired you. So where's that Pensky 
               file? Let's see what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you've been up to all week. (pages through the file) What have 
               you been doing all week?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well you missed a lovely little party 
               that we had for Grace.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TUTTLE
</b>               You haven't done anything with this.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller 
               office.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TUTTLE
</b>               I'm beginning to wonder if you understand 
               anything.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You are aware that Pensky is interested 
               in me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TUTTLE
</b>               (scoffs) You're not Pensky material.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, 
               Tut-tle.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               At Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b>               Gino and Enzo are watching "Edward Scissorhands" on TV. They 
               are both sobbing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               At the barber shop.

<b>               
</b>               "Barber of Seville" music is playing.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks in the barber shop window and sees Newman giving 
               a guy a haircut. He enters. Newman looks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               at him scared. Jerry picks up an electric razor and walks toward 
               Newman. Newman is very frightened.

</b>               Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the 
               wrong impression. What is was going 
               to say was, now you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself 
               included, and we're prohibited from doing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, 
               we would have no use for you.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Obviously.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George waves his hand and the final note of "Barber of Seville" 
               plays.
