</b>               Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? 
               You're no good with the sticks.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I know. I need a lesson.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You stink. You know you stink. What 
               is this?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. My ballet tickets.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh. Your ballet tickets.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, I'm going as a beard.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A beard?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. This friend of a friend knows 
               this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 
               30 years, unbelievably
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               gorgeous, of course he's gay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So anyway his boss has a box at the 
               Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, 
               which is fine, but he's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going 
               along as his date.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why are you doing this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Swan Lake, at the Met.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks 
               in that thing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I think he looks fantastic.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, come on.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, I never realized what an attractive 
               man he is.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George enters, wearing a toupee.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, people, people, people, people, 
               people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You look ridiculous in that thing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is that so? Or could it be that you're 
               just a *little* bit worried that you 
               may have missed the boat?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well I think they might have sutured 
               that thing to your brain.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, 
               deride, deride if you must. But let 
               me tell you something, with
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? 
               I am in the game. I no longer defer to the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               coifed. I'm a player.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know I just thought of something. 
               I know this gorgeous woman, she called 
               me up this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know 
               of anyone she could meet. Now you can
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               go out with her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well what about me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No I think he's got you beat buddy.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, 
               five years ago.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I have to see her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, I know what we can do. I've got 
               a friend who works over at the police 
               station. He's a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               composite artist.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw 
               a picture of her for you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh I would love that. You think he'd

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It sounds like an excellent idea.

               always wanted to see how those sketch 
               artists do it.

</b><b>                             HOMELESS MAN
</b>               Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn

</b><b>                             HOMELESS MAN
</b>               I don't think so.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             HOMELESS MAN
</b>               You gave it to me.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, I didn't say you could keep 
               it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HOMELESS MAN
</b>               You should have said something.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I didn't think I had to. Look with a

<b>

</b><b>                             ROBERT

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             BOSS
</b>               I'm surprised.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Really. Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             BOSS
</b>               No reason.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. 
               Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* 
               *man*, if
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of 
               ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here 
               tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's 
               those two halves of his personality that just
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               come together to make him the very special guy that he is.

<b>               
</b>               Robert comes back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, hi honey.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine grabs Robert and kisses him.

<b>               
</b>               At Monk's.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh it was such a great night.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And did they suspect anything?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I was a fantastic beard. I held

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And we discover yet another talent.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You said that already.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, I know.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well it did occur to me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You think you can get him to just change 
               teams? He's not going to suddenly switch 
               sides. Forget
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               about it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why? Is it irrevocable?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because when you join that team it's 
               not a whim. He likes his team. He's 
               set with that team.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We've got a good team.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why can't he play for us?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They're only comfortable with *their* 
               equipment.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We just got along *so* great.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Of course you did. Everyone gets along 
               great when there's no possibility of 
               sex.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, no, no, I sensed something. I did 
               sense something. I perceived a possibility 
               Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You realize you're venturing into uncharted

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I realize that.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why didn't anything happen between you

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So did you describe yourself to her

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               I don't know.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I told her the truth.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did you tell her about, uh, your little

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You only think that because you know

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I noticed people staring at my head

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I think you should either take

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No he's not going to take it off. If

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going

<b>

<b>

</b>               Everyone turns left. Kramer turns right.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               Kramer turns to the right doing a "hokey pokey" dance.

<b>               
</b>               At Monk's.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (thinking to himself) Oh my god, there

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is

</b><b>                             TIERNEY
</b>               A polygraph. It's what you civilians

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I mean every time I mention it you never

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and 
               take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did 
               she enjoy it?

</b>               Did Jane sleep with Michael again?

</b>               (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. 
               He left her for Kimberly, he slept with 
               her sister. He tricked
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead 
               and sleeps with him again. I mean she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she 
               makes me so mad.
<b>

</b>               He picks up his coat and leaves.

</b>               He went back? What do you mean he went 
               back?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't understand it. You were having 
               such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well here's the thing. Being a woman, 
               I only really have access to the, uh... 
               equipment, what,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. 
               How can I be expected to have the same
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access 
               to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lives.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You can't. That's why they lose very 
               few players.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, I guess I never really stood a 
               chance.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well there's always a place for you, 
               on our team.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose 
               Place on?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.

</b>               Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. 
               I really do admire what you've done.

</b>               Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's 
               proud of me Jerry.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What is the matter?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald 
               woman rejected me. Heh, you like that 
               one? A woman
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. 
               Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well I'll tell you what I think. I think 
               she saw you with that piece off and 
               was devastated. You
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. 
               Didn't you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I didn't ruin anything. He looked like 
               an idiot. He did, and it made him act 
               like a jerk.
<b>
