<b>                           THE BIG SALAD
</b>

</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               It's fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they're               
               manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we're all buying them. 
               I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I've used up maybe 
               two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator 
               there's a couple back there but it doesn't account for it. Where are all 
               the pens?
<b> 
</b>               That's why it's so embarrassing if you don't have one. You got 
               a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it's so 
               humiliating. 

               I don't have a pen. They're making millions of them every week! I know; 
               where are they?

               1000 mechanical pencil.

               fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me 
               by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about 
               to hit his second shot, when, he picks 
               up the ball and CLEANS it.

               that you cannot clean the ball unless 
               it's on the green. The rules are very 
               clear about that.

               to Police headquarters for questioning 
               the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner 
               of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam 
               Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson 
               had been involved in a dispute with 
               the cleaner about a stain on a pair 
               of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also 
               have a report that earlier in the day

               Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving 
               the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there 
               is a possible connection between the 
               two is something we'll just have to 
               wait.

</b>               Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the 
               penalty stroke that he murdered the 
               dry cleaner.

</b>               Well, generally speaking you don't need 
               any extra incentive to murder a dry 
               cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.

</b>               Because that's the way I weas raised. 
               You know when I was growing up I had 
               to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. 
               And if I wasn't, well I don't have to 
               tell you what happened.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of 
               pants into Pinkus' and they came back 
               stained with some kind of dry cleaning 
               fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. 
               You see he was very upset with Pinkus.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               better hurry up and leave or you'd make 
               her buy lunch to make up for the one 
               you bought yesterday.

               the big salad, when I was the one who 
               handed it to her?

               suggesting that I went out of my way 
               to tell Elaine that even though you 
               handed her the big salad, that it came 
               from me?

               I wouldn't have said anything. But you 
               had to have the BIG SALAD.

               it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. 
               (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They 
               issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. 
               He escaped and the police spotted him 
               on the New Jersey Turnpike.

</b>               As you can see white Bronco. The police 
               have cleared the highway traffic in 
               front of him but they are keeping their 
               distance and don't want the situation 
               to escalate. And we have gotten an identification 
               on the driver of the vehicle. His name 
               is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing 
               buddies.

               in the car. He wants to see his fish. 
               I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell 
               the police to back off.

</b>               Jail doesn't really seem like that great 
               of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle 
               psychological mind games be a lot more 
               satisfying? Constantly calling him, 
               hanging up when he answers the phone. 
               Sending pizzas and taxis to their house 
               all night long. After a while he would 
               go, "I wish that guy would kill me already, 
               I can't take it anymore." And how come 
               when the police catch some really bad 
               criminal or something they put him in 
               the handcuffs, they hit him with the 
               baton, they put the choke hold on him, 
               then they're always careful they don't 
               want him to hurt his head when they're 
               putting him in the back of the patrol 
               car. "Watch your head, watch your head. 
               Don't hit that metal edge there. . . 
               . That REALLY hurts"
