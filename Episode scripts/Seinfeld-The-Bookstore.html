</b>               First it was the health club, then the 
               supermarket, now the bookstore. They 
               could put it anywhere they want, no 
               one's meetin' anybody.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Kramer walks up to Jerry and George while leafing through a 
               book)

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? 
               I gotta get over to Hong Kong before 
               it all goes back to China..

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm gonna hit the head.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed 
               the rickshaw. See, I always thought 
               those would be perfect for New York.
<b>

               at last year?
