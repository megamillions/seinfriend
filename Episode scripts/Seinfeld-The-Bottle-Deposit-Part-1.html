</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I love it when you get your car back 
               from the car place, and it's got that 
               paper mat on the floor. Like they're 
               so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't 
               even want their shoes to touch the carpet. 
               Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he 
               looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in 
               goo, from head to toe. You can't even 
               see him. Although, I prefer that to 
               when they have the lab coat, The clipboard 
               and the nice glasses. Now you know you're 
               getting screwed. (as concerned car owner) 
               'Can I see it?' (as doctor-like mechanic) 
               'You better not. It's idling quietly 
               right now. I think it should stay overnight. 
               We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna 
               keep the bill running up.'

</b>               (Yankee Stadium)

<b>               
</b>               Mr Wilhelm is hurrying along a corridor, with George trailing 
               in his
<b> 
</b>               wake. As Wilhelm speaks, George is making notes onto a pad and 
               looking
<b> 
</b>               flustered.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WILHELM
</b>               And you can tell the players that I 
               reimburse the trainer for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The cigarettes and the dive checks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WILHELM
</b>               The trainer, George. Tell the players 
               I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the 
               matter with you? This is the third time 
               I've had to repeat myself.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WILHELM
</b>               Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running 
               a ball club here
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George. You've got to pay attention.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know, sir. It won't happen again.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WILHELM
</b>               Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment 
               for you... uh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Wilhelm wanders across the corridor, thinking to himself, he 
               opens the door to the men's room and strolls through.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WILHELM
</b>               Lemme think here.

<b>               
</b>               George starts to follow Wilhelm into the men's room, but thinks 
               better of it. He wonders briefly what to do, then leans against 
               the wall by the door, to await Wilhelm's return.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine sits behind her desk working at her computer. Mr Peterman
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               enters. He's carrying an auction house catalogue.

</b><b>                             PETERMAN

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             PETERMAN
</b>               It was the Peace Corps that gave me 
               my start in this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.

</b><b>                             PETERMAN
</b>               Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's 
               memorabilia. One item
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. 
               To me, they
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Whatever.

</b><b>                             PETERMAN
</b>               But, unfortunately I will be out of 
               town with my lady-friend
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               And therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you 
               would go in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               my stead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd 
               be happy to. Uhm, how much
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high 
               are you willing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to go?

</b><b>                             PETERMAN
</b>               I would see no trouble in spending up 
               to, say, ten thousand
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.

<b>               
</b>               He drops the catalogue on the surprised Elaine's desk and exits.

<b>               
</b>               George still waits outside the men's room. He's been waiting 
               a while.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               He looks at his watch and decides to go in. As he enters, he 
               finds Wilhelm
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               emerging from a stall, and still talking.

<b>

</b><b>               
</b>               Steinbrenner is very interested in this.

<b>

</b><b>               
</b>               it out.

<b>               
</b>               A woman puts a soda can on top of a mail box while she reaches 
               into her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bag for something to post. A hand reaches from behind the box, 
               picks up the can
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and disappears back behind the box. The woman is flummoxed by 
               the can's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               disappearance.

<b>               
</b>               Newman stands nonchalantly beside a dumpster with a plastic sack
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               containing some bottles and cans. In the dumpster, Kramer roots 
               about beneath the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               plastic and cardboard, before coming up and handing a bottle 
               to Newman, who drops
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it into his sack.

<b>               
</b>               In Monk's, a waitress puts a tray of empty bottle onto a shelf 
               behind
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer, who's eating a meal. As she leaves, he reaches behind 
               him, takes the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               tray and tips the bottles into another plastic sack.

<b>               
</b>               Newman stands in a doorway on the street. A homeless guy pushes 
               a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shopping cart full of bottles and cans past. Newman drops a few 
               coins onto the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sidewalk, attracting the attention of the homeless guy, who leaves 
               his cart to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               retrieve the change. Newman darts from the doorway, grabs hold 
               of the cart and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               races away down the street, leaving the homeless guy shaking 
               a fist and yelling
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               after him.

<b>               
</b>               Newman finishes a bottle of soda and hands the empty to Kramer, 
               who
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Hands another bottle to Newman. There's a long line of empty 
               bottles already
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               on the table and Newman's looking close to capacity. As Newman 
               reluctantly
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               begins to drink this latest one, Kramer opens another and taps 
               him on the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               stomach, causing Newman to splutter and spray soda across the 
               table.

</b><b>               
</b>               A cigar-smoking Kramer and a gleeful Newman, regard the back 
               of a mail
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               truck, filled with plastic sacks of bottles and cans. They slap 
               palms and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shake hands as Kramer pulls down the door and flips the handle 
               closed.

               and I just wanna hear it from you. But 
               I want you to be straight with me. Don't 
               lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor 
               oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) 
               From one of those quicky lube places, 
               isn't it?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I change it so often, I mean to 
               come all the way down here...

</b>               Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of 
               a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade 
               oil, you could damage vital engine parts. 
               Okay. (holds up component) See this 
               gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence 
               in that gasket.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TONY
</b>               Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul 
               the entire engine. But it's gonna take 
               a major commitment from you. You're 
               gonna have to keep it under sixty miles 
               an hour for a while. You gotta come 
               in, and you gotta get the oil changed 
               every thousand miles.

</b>               (contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. 
               It's your own car we're Talking about. 
               You know you wrote the wrong mileage 
               down on the form? You barely know the 
               car. You don't know the mileage, you 
               don't know the tyre pressure. When was 
               the last time you even checked the washer 
               fluid?

<b>               
</b>               There is the sound of a car starting up, then a squeal of tires 
               and 
               Jerry's Saab emerges from the auto shop at high speed. It passes 
               Jerry and Elaine and 
               Races away down the street. They stare open-mouthed after the 
               car, and at each other in astonishment.
