</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I didn't count on my mechanic 
               pulling a Mary-Beth
<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               He's a very special maniac.

</b>               What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.

</b><b>                             PETERMAN

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be 
               a bit of a snag.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             PETERMAN

               absconded with my
<b>

<b>

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt 
               that said 'Tony'. Lemme
<b> 
</b>               ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             DETECTIVE

<b> 
</b>               thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. 
               I'm gonna ask
<b> 
</b>               you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but 
               I think it'll
<b> 
</b>               help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             DETECTIVE
</b>               Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you 
               zip over speed bumps?
<b> 
</b>               Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               W-well, what does it matter? It's my 
               car, I can do whatever I
<b> 
</b>               want with it.

<b>               
</b>               The detective stares at Jerry.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not that I would think of doing such 
               things.

               we'll let you know if
<b> 
</b>               we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never

</b>               Kramer is driving the truck along a highway in daylight.

<b>

</b>               How much gas we got?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Three quarters of a tank.

<b>               
</b>               Newman punches the numbers into a calculator.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's better than we estimated.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               (smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two 
               cents better.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               They give a smug little laugh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ah, no, that's not in the budget.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. 
               I mean, it might be a
<b> 
</b>               good investment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's not a good investment, that's 
               a loss.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               A convertible black Saab passes the mail truck.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like 
               Jerry's. I'm gonna check
<b> 
</b>               out that license plate.

<b>               
</b>               He accelerates the mail truck to close on the Saab, and leans 
               forward,
<b> 
</b>               straining to make out the plate.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, those are New York plates.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Is that Jerry's number?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I don't know, but that's New York and 
               we're in Ohio. Those are
<b> 
</b>               pretty good odds.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer reaches under his seat, rummaging for something.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               What're you doing?

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               He pulls out his mobile and hits the speed dial for Jerry.

               very troubling, very
<b> 
</b>               troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.

<b>               
</b>               Two burly guys who are clearly medical orderlies come into the 
               room
<b> 
</b>               behind George.

               George, this is Herb
<b> 
</b>               and Dan.

<b>               
</b>               George regards the two guys, very nervously as they approach 
               him and
<b> 
</b>               stand behind him, one on either shoulder.

<b>               
</b><b>                             STEINBRENNER
</b>               They're gonna take you away to a nice 
               place where you can
<b> 
</b>               get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law 
               was there
<b> 
</b>               for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. 
               They
<b> 
</b>               completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Herb and Dan take hold of George's arms. George gets panicky.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               report. That, that's not
<b> 
</b>               mine.

<b>               
</b>               Herb and Dan begin to drag the struggling George across the office
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               toward the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             STEINBRENNER
</b>               Of course you didn't George. Of course 
               you didn't write
<b> 
</b>               it.

               I don't know how it got
<b> 
</b>               done, but it did.

<b>               
</b>               As Herb and Dan haul George through the door, George makes his 
               last
<b> 
</b>               stand, trying to get a hold on the doorframe with his feet. Eventually 
               he is
<b> 
</b>               dragged out into the corridor and vanishes from view.

<b>               
</b><b>                             STEINBRENNER
</b>               Of course. Of course it got done. Things 
               get done all the
<b> 
</b>               time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your 
               job'll be waiting
<b> 
</b>               for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get 
               better George.
<b> 
</b>               Get better!

<b>               
</b>               Kramer crouches as far as he can. Tony flings the object at Kramer's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               mail truck. It crashes against the windshield and bounces away.
<b>

<b>               
</b>               Tony hurls another club at the mail truck. Again, it bounces 
               off the
<b> 
</b>               windshield, leaving some cracks.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               Tony flings a heavy wood at the truck.

<b>               
</b>               The Saab leads the truck down the road, with Tony hurling club 
               after
<b> 
</b>               club over his shoulder and into the front of the truck.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Tony hurls the golf bag at the truck. It slams solidly against 
               the
<b> 
</b>               windshield, Kramer flinches, the truck swerves. The front wheel 
               runs over a club on
<b> 
</b>               the tarmac and the tyre bursts.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The

<b> 
</b>               staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam 
               and smoke erupts from

<b>               
</b>               Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. 
               He kicks
<b> 
</b>               the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks 
               a club off
<b> 
</b>               the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of 
               the radiator
<b> 
</b>               grille.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He 
               comes
<b> 
</b>               upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over 
               his shoulder, he
<b> 
</b>               continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as 
               he goes.

               with cutlery, but
<b> 
</b>               she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and 
               tries to take a

               he

               out and the

               heard yelling

               to procreate.

</b>               Elaine puts the bag of clubs down beside Peterman. The clubs 
               are, of course, wrecked. Elaine looks like she's expecting a 
               poor reaction. Peterman picks up a club or two, staring in disbelief 
               at the twisted metal.

               in the side pocket there.

               Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was 
               his slice. (she laughs nervously)
