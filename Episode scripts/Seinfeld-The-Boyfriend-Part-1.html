                             Written by

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and 
               they're
<b> 
</b>               working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape 
               but the
<b> 
</b>               strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. 
               The only
<b> 
</b>               reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through 
               the
<b> 
</b>               workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for 
               when we have
<b> 
</b>               to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing 
               I don't get
<b> 
</b>               about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty 
               towels and
<b> 
</b>               smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these 
               disgusting gym
<b> 
</b>               clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt 
               because he
<b> 
</b>               has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't 
               even think
<b> 
</b>               about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of 
               these locks
<b> 
</b>               you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff 
               is safe.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Wide open, I was wide open underneath! 
               I had three inches on that
<b> 
</b>               guy. You two were hogging the ball.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the 
               ball. All you do is dribble.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have to dribble, if I give it to you, 
               you just shoot. You're a
<b> 
</b>               chucker.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh I'm a chucker.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's right, everytime you get the 
               ball you shoot.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't believe you called me a chucker. 
               No way I'm a chucker, I do
<b> 
</b>               not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, 
               no chuck!

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               don't want to have.

</b>               eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

               Whatever the
<b> 
</b>               group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're 
               not
<b> 
</b>               interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not 
               interested in
<b> 
</b>               seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't 
               know the food.
<b> 
</b>               They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on 
               the gym or
<b> 
</b>               someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have 
               a lot of
<b> 
</b>               potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when 
               you're a kid,
<b> 
</b>               you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little 
               kid what were
<b> 
</b>               the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's 
               my friend,
<b> 
</b>               they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! 
               Come on in. Jump
<b> 
</b>               up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at 
               all, You like
<b> 
</b>               Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!

</b>               Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. 
               According to your story Keith
<b> 
</b>               passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were 
               struck on
<b> 
</b>               the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the 
               temple
<b> 
</b>               striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then 
               cam off
<b> 
</b>               the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him 
               to drop his
<b> 
</b>               baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In 
               mid air
<b> 
</b>               mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. 
               That is one
<b> 
</b>               magic luggie.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well. uh, well my head went back and

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I am saying that the spit could not 
               have come from behind ... that there 
               had to have been
<b> 
</b>               a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the 
               spitter was behind you as you claimed
<b> 
</b>               that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So the spit could have only come from 
               the front and to the right.

</b><b>                             JERRY

               you believe.
