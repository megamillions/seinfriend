<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know who it was too. It was the guy 
               who interviewed me. He was
<b> 
</b>               very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? I could 
               sell
<b> 
</b>               latex like that (snaps fingers).

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               Sign that.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Who is this? (sees photo)

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               It's my daughta'

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               THIS is your daughter? My God! My God! 
               I I hope you don't mind my
<b> 
</b>               saying. She is breathtaking.

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               Ya' think so?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ah, would you take this picture away 
               from me. Take it away and get
<b> 
</b>               it outta here. Let me just sign this and go.

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL

<b> 
</b>               trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you 
               that.
<b> 
</b><b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               I'm serious.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's one think to not give me the extension 
               But to tease and to
<b> 
</b>               torture me like this. There's no call for that.

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               Would you like her phone numba'?

<b>                             MRS. SOKOL
</b>               Mrs. Sokol I, I don't know what to say. 
               I, uh, where should I sign this
<b> 
</b>               thing?

               I'd
<b> 
</b>               say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not 
               that much. First we got
<b> 
</b>               the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.

<b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that apart. Then we got the couch.

<b>                             JERRY

</b><b>               
</b>               When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all 
               you think about is
<b> 
</b>               boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the 
               street going in and out
<b> 
</b>               of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean 
               it's all you think
<b> 
</b>               about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. 
               Shut up I'm looking
<b> 
</b>               for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it 
               you can smell them. You walk
<b> 
</b>               into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have 
               boxes. Dammit, I can
<b> 
</b>               SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard 
               in the morning. You
<b> 
</b>               could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and 
               your looking at the
<b> 
</b>               casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got 
               that box? When he's
<b> 
</b>               done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice 
               handles on it. And that's
<b> 
</b>               what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The 
               hearse is like the van. The
<b> 
</b>               pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask 
               to help you with a big
<b> 
</b>               move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've 
               been waiting for your
<b> 
</b>               whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.
