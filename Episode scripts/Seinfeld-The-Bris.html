</b>          willing these great parking spots.
          In front of my house. In front

          do me a favor, could you tape the

          who love them discussion and

          here. I've got to find a Mohel.

</b>          Perhaps one day when the pigmen

</b>          Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
          It's been a very trying couple
          of
<b>          
</b>          days around the hospital. Patients,
          doctors, everyone, just grief
<b>          
</b>          stricken over this unfortunate
          occurrence.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          Well, I join them in their grief.
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. Sweedler
<b>          
</b>          Horrible, just a horrible thing.
          Flew right past the children's
<b>          
</b>          wing. All the sick children, in
          the playroom, looking out the
<b>          
</b>          window, just traumatize by the
          incident. Apparently, they all
<b>          
</b>          thought he was flying. You know
          how children are, "Oh look. A man
<b>          
</b>          is flying. A man is flying" And
          then, splat...
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          Yes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's
          where I come in. On splat. You
<b>          
</b>          see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital
          administrator Sweedler?
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. Sweedler
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          You see, that trudge affected me
          in a very, very personal way.
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. SWEEDLER
<b>          
</b>          How is that?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          Yes, you see, the deceased landed
          on my car. The splat, as it
<b>          
</b>          were, actually took place on the
          roof of my car. I can't help but
<b>          
</b>          think that had it been a convertible
          this whole tragedy may have
<b>          
</b>          been averted but I've never been
          the type to buy a convertible,
<b>          
</b>          what with the baldness and all.
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. SWEEDLER
<b>          
</b>          Well I've known bald men who owned
          convertibles. They wore a hat.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          Well then it's all pulled down.
          Anyway. The damage,
<b>          
</b>          unfortunately, has marred an otherwise
          fine automobile, rendering
<b>          
</b>          it virtually undriveable.
<b>          
</b>          Mrs. SWEEDLER
<b>          
</b>          (STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is
          a shame.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       GEORGE          
</b>          Yes, a shame. That's just how I
          would describe it. Now, with all
<b>          
</b>          due sensitivity and discretion,
          bearing in mind the scope of the
<b>          
</b>          situation, I can't help but think
          the hospital bears some
<b>          
</b>          responsibility to compensate the
          other, still living "victim", of
<b>          
</b>          this horrendous, horrendous tragedy.

          you chose the absolute edge, so
<b>          
</b>          half the glass is hanging off the
          table, you breath and that
<b>
