<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. 
               What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. 
               How can I go out with a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               girl with a laugh like that? It's like Coco Chanel goin' out 
               with a fish monger.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish mongers a pretty 
               bad smell.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. 
               Susan can't stand him. He vomited all 
               over her.
