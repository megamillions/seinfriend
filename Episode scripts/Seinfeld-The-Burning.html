<b>                           THE BURNING
</b>


                           Written by

                       Jennifer Crittenden




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine is getting ready to drive Puddy's car, he's giving her 
               last minute
<b> 
</b>               instructions.

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               And don't move the seat, I got it right 
               where I like it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Goodbye?

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Two and ten, babe.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Okay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Don't peel out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I won't.

<b>               
</b>               is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..." Elaine changes the 
               stations but all
<b> 
</b>               of the presets are set to religious radio stations; "And he said 
               unto
<b> 
</b>               Abraham...", "Amen! Amen!", "So we pray...", "Saved!", "Jey-sus!" 
               She turns
<b> 
</b>               off the radio.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jesus?

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRUGER
</b>               According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger 
               Industrial Smoothing is
<b> 
</b>               heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. 
               Any thoughts?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, 
               I sometimes drop off my rent
<b> 
</b>               check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRUGER
</b>               Works for me. Good thinking, George.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CO-WORKER 1
</b>               Alright, George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CO-WORKER 2
</b>               Way to go man.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Or we don't even send the check and 
               then when they call, we pretend
<b> 
</b>               we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here 
               Kruger."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRUGER
</b>               Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, 
               let's get real.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CO-WORKER 1
</b>               Good one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CO-WORKER 2
</b>               That was bad.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And then?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I lost them. I can usually come up with 
               one good comment during a
<b> 
</b>               meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and 
               bad puns.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Showmanship, George. When you hit that 
               high note, you say goodnight and
<b> 
</b>               walk off.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't just leave.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's the way they do it in Vegas.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You never played Vegas.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I hear things.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters and has a seat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and 
               all the presets on his radio
<b> 
</b>               were Christian rock stations.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I like Christian rock. It's very positive. 
               It's not like those real
<b> 
</b>               musicians who think they're so cool and hip.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, you think that Puddy actually believes 
               in something?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's a used car, he probably never changed 
               the presets.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yes, he is lazy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Plus he probably doesn't even know how 
               to program the buttons.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yes, he is dumb.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Dumb and lazy, I understand.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Tell you how you could check.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               How?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Reprogram all the buttons, see if he 
               changes them back. You know? The
<b> 
</b>               old switcheroo.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison 
               your drink then you switch it
<b> 
</b>               with the other person's.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, it's doing the same thing to someone 
               that they did to you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing 
               to Puddy's radio that the radio
<b> 
</b>               did to her.

<b>

               that I haven't told you about.
<b> 
</b>               See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.

</b>               Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's 
               important is I'm not
<b> 
</b>               gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very 
               long-term and
<b>

<b> 
</b>               with it.

</b><b>                             SOPHIE
</b>               No, I understand. This could be a tough 
               thing to deal with. The
<b> 
</b>               important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             SOPHIE
</b>               Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. 
               I got gonorrhea from a
<b> 
</b>               tractor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And 
               you call *that* your tractor
<b> 
</b>               story??

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You can't get it from that.

</b><b>                             SOPHIE
</b>               But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea 
               from riding the tractor
<b> 
</b>               in my bathing suit.

<b> 
</b>               name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' 
               fell off and
<b> 
</b>               all it says now is K-uger!
