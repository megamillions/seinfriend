</b>               So why don't you get a locksmith?

               that the auto club has this free locksmith 
               service, so I signed up. Just waiting 
               for the membership to kick in.

               the Yankee parking lot?

               Stan's advice has
<b> 
</b>               transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually 
               I'll
<b> 
</b>               have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my 
               dream,
