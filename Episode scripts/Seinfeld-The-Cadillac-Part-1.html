<b>                         THE CADILLAC PART 1
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry enters, carrying a couple of bags and his mail. No sooner 
               has he put his bags down than Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey! You're back!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I'm back, baby.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, how was it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Good for you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I killed.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You killed.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. 
               Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging 
               up jacket) not only that, the money 
               was unbelievable.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Unbelievable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               How much?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Aw, c'mon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah. It's not good for friends to talk 
               about money, it can affect the friendship.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I tell you how much I make.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And I'm always impressed.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Just show me the cheque, c'mon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Awright, fine. You wanna see it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I wanna see it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry gets out his wallet, extracts a cheque from within it and 
               hands it to Kramer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Here, check that out.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer reads the cheque, and a look of astonishment comes to 
               his face.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I told you.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer has to sit on the couch, he's so shocked.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               My god, you're rich.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (taking back the check) Oh yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I didn't know you made that kinda money. 
               (subdued) Jeez.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I don't think I can talk to you any 
               more. I feel inferior.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I never shoulda told you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know, Jerry, I think this changes 
               the relationship. I mean, I
<b> 
</b>               feel it. Do you feel it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I can't feel anything.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, what're you gonna do with all 
               that money?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Actually, I was thinking of donating 
               a large portion of it to
<b> 
</b>               charity.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (pleased) Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (deadpan) No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, you should, Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking 
               of buying my father a new
<b> 
</b>               car.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Now, you see, that's nice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe a Cadillac.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow 
               his mind. He's always wanted
<b> 
</b>               one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) 
               I'm gonna
<b> 
</b>               do it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You're gonna score some big points with 
               the man upstairs on this
<b> 
</b>               one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer and Jerry smile in agreement.

               two and
<b> 
</b>               six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without 
               so much as a
<b> 
</b>               phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all 
               over my nice

<b>               
</b>               Nick, the cable guy is standing by Kramer's door. George wanders 
               up to
<b> 
</b>               Jerry's door and, as he gets there, is addressed.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NICK
</b>               Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               George moves to open Jerry's door, but the cable guy is still 
               talking.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NICK
</b>               (quietly angry) All morning I been waiting 
               here. All morning.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Peering through the peephole, Kramer makes a noise of excited 
               satisfaction.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NICK
</b>               (still angry) The guy says he's gonna 
               be home. I show up and all I do
<b> 
</b>               is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna 
               put up with
<b> 
</b>               it much longer.

<b>               
</b>               The cable guy stalks away. Inside Jerry's, Kramer turns to speak 
               to Jerry
<b> 
</b>               and Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I'm loving this.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer lowers his eye to the peephole again, just as George opens 
               the door.
<b> 
</b>               The door cracks Kramer on the forehead with a thump. George enters. 
               Kramer
<b> 
</b>               peers round George to check the cable guy's gone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Kramer, there's a guy out here that...

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer exits and crosses the hall to his apartment. George closes 
               the door
<b> 
</b>               behind himself, and takes off his coat. He notices Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is standing by the kitchen counter. He has a stack of bank 
               notes and
<b> 
</b>               is counting them. Elaine is mesmerised by the sight of all that 
               currency.
<b> 
</b>               She stands by the counter, her eyes locked onto the money.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses

</b>               didn't hear what you said.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks almost dizzy at the prospect of all that cash.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b>               the phone) Please, make the call.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine picks up the phone and dials a number.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (triumph) Alright.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry resumes his counting, but has lost track of where he was 
               up to. He
<b> 
</b>               stands, holding one bill, trying to recall. Elaine has obviously 
               been paying
<b> 
</b>               more attention, even as she dialled the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Eight-fifty.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, right.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine waits for the phone to be picked up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

               car.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               As Jerry goes to leave the kitchen, Elaine is sure to keep in 
               his path,
<b> 
</b>               smiling flirtatiously.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (big smile) Okay.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is finally allowed out of the kitchen by Elaine, and heads 
               for the
<b> 
</b>               bedroom. The phone is picked up at the other end of Elaine's 
               line. As Elaine
<b> 
</b>               speaks, George stands beside her, doing a little selection of 
               dances.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

               Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens)
<b> 
</b>               Oh, really?

<b>               
</b>               Something about the tone of her voice causes George to cease 
               dancing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, could you tell her Elaine called? 
               Yeah, thanks.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine turns to an expectant George.
