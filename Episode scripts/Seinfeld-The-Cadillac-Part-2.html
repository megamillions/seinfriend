<b>                         THE CADILLAC PART 2
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Morty and Helen's, Florida)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is trying, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the infamous fold-out. 
               He twists and turns, but can't find a comfortable position.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put 
               the bar in the middle of the bed?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry continues to thrash about in discomfort. The phone rings 
               and Jerry picks it up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hello?

<b>               
</b>               On the other end of the line is Elaine, in bed back in New York.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (flirtatious) Hi Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Elaine? Wh..what's going on?

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rests on one elbow, playing with her hair as she chats 
               playfully with Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, 
               I'm not really doing that much this 
               weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what 
               the hell, maybe I'll come down there 
               and hang out a little.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (a little confused) You wanna hang out 
               here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar 
               Gables?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gives a slightly overdone girly giggle-laugh at Jerry's 
               comment.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, it's just two hours by plane...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Gee, I dunno what to tell you.

<b>               
</b>               There is a beep from Elaine's phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang 
               on, don't hang up Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine hits a button on her phone to take the other call.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah?

<b>               
</b>               The other call is George. He sits on his couch in his dressing 
               gown.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got 
               to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (impatient) Okay, George, I am on the 
               other line. I promise you, I'll get 
               you her number.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George punches the air in triumph, and sits back on the couch.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeahhh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Goodbye.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine hits the button on her phone again, to reconnect with 
               Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (smiling and flirty) Hi.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hi.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, I don't think so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (disappointed) Oh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'll be back on Monday.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, 
               gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I 
               can meet you at the gate, Jer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll 
               see you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry is moving to put down the phone when Elaine speaks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (urgent) Jerry? Jerry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (putting the phone back to his ear) 
               Yeah.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (breathy) Bye.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Bye.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry puts down the phone, still a little bemused by Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Kramer's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               The phone rings and Kramer picks up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hello.

<b>               
</b>               Somewhere outside, a guy in overalls and a safety helmet is on 
               the phone. He's
<b> 
</b>               writing on a clipboard as he speaks to Kramer.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JOHN
</b>               Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, 
               from Con Ed.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer gets a smile on his face, thinking it's another of the 
               cable guy's
<b> 
</b>               tricks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JOHN
</b>               Yeah. We've had some reports of power 
               surges in your building. It
<b> 
</b>               seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged 
               some of the
<b> 
</b>               wires.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, you don't say.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer walks to his window as he listens.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JOHN
</b>               (a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. 
               Either way, we need to get into your
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               apartment and do a safety check.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer opens his blinds slightly, as he did before. But there 
               is no cable guy in
<b> 
</b>               the phone box across the street, only a woman talking on the 
               phone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are

<b>               
</b>               Elaine sits in a booth. George enters, looking unnaturally happy, 
               and comes
<b> 
</b>               over.

</b>               And I wasn't even that nervous.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine watches George, as he rambles on.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (looking at her watch) Okay, well that's

<b> 
</b>               Why don't we pick up with this next week?

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rises.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What? You can't leave yet.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We have to discuss my alibi.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Alibi? What does that have to do with

</b>               I usually spend Saturday afternoons

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine sets off to leave, but is stopped by George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Because, if you ever see her and it 
               comes up, we have to be in sync.
<b> 
</b>               Hmm?

<b>               
</b>               Reluctantly, Elaine sits back down with a sigh, as George furrows 
               his brow in
<b> 
</b>               concentration.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) 
               you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George and Elaine both think hard for a moment. Then Elaine gets 
               a flash of
<b> 
</b>               inspiration.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, 
               and I'm afraid, and I want you to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               go with me.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine smiles and makes a 'voila' gesture.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (dismissive) It's no good.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks offended.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (pointedly) Okay. Fine.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't like the way you just rejected

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive 
               here. This is a give and take
<b> 
</b>               process.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I thought that my suggestion was good. 
               And, I think you could've been a
<b> 
</b>               little more tactful.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (explaining, with lots of hand gestures) 
               Okay, look. We've never worked
<b> 
</b>               together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have 
               a certain way of
<b> 
</b>               working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows 
               how I work. It's
<b> 
</b>               not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with 
               the best
<b> 
</b>               possible lie. That's what this is all about.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (weary) Okay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Okay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Okay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Fine, fine, fine.

<b>               
</b>               The twosome go back to thinking for a while. This time George 
               gets the
<b> 
</b>               inspiration.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Okay. How about this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               am meeting you to discuss the situation.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't have a boyfriend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (still pleased) She doesn't know that. 
               We say that you do.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (not convinced) Ech.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's good. Believe me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I thought my idea was just as good.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is 
               my boyfriend?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's your boyfriend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What does he do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He's an importer.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Just imports? No exports?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. 
               Okay?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What 
               is the problem we're discussing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (thoughtful) Yes. Yes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (sighs) Yi-yi-yi.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and George go into another bout of deep thought.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) 
               How 'bout this? How about, he's
<b> 
</b>               thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on 
               the importing. And
<b> 
</b>               this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?

<b>               
</b>               Elaine finishes with an expectant smile. George looks skeptical, 
               and Elaine
<b> 
</b>               seems offended again.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (irked) Oh, what? You don't like that 
               suggestion either?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's very complicated.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (definitely irritated) You know, it 
               seems to me that it's all you, and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know 
               it all and I am
<b> 
</b>               Miss Stupid. Right?

<b>               
</b>               George avoids Elaine's gaze, looking down.

<b> 
</b>               around.

               and cups from

               He becomes
<b> 
</b>               aware that a vehicle is slowly driving along the road just behind 
               him. Kramer
<b> 
</b>               shifts his load of groceries, so that a shiny baking tray is 
               in a position he
<b> 
</b>               can use it as a mirror. Behind him, he can see the blurry image 
               of a Plaza Cable
<b> 
</b>               truck. Kramer begins to walk faster, then breaks into a run.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer slows from his run, and looks behind himself. A smile 
               comes to his face,
<b> 
</b>               as he sees the truck is no longer there. He allows himself a 
               little shrug of
<b> 
</b>               satisfaction at having beaten the cable guy. Kramer turns and 
               begins to walk on,
<b> 
</b>               with his groceries, when there is a screech of tyres and the 
               cable truck comes
<b> 
</b>               to a halt in front of him - having taken another route to head 
               him off.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The cable guy gives a 'come here' gesture with his forefinger 
               through the truck
<b> 
</b>               window. Kramer turns and sets off running. He runs into a litter 
               bin, drops his
<b> 
</b>               groceries and falls to the floor. The cable guy climbs from his 
               truck and begins
<b> 
</b>               to advance on Kramer. Kramer picks himself up and, abandoning 
               his groceries,
<b> 
</b>               sets off running again, with the cable guy in pursuit.

               then sets off
<b> 
</b>               running. Moments later, the cable guy struggles over the same 
               wall and sets off
<b> 
</b>               after Kramer.

<b> 
</b>               few yards behind.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer runs across a New York rooftop. He comes to the edge of 
               the roof and
<b> 
</b>               looks for a way across to the next building. Kramer looks worriedly 
               behind him,
<b> 
</b>               for the pursuing cable guy, then down into the gap between buildings. 
               Despite
<b> 
</b>               his worry at the height, he steps back a few paces, takes a run-up, 
               and leaps
<b> 
</b>               across to land on the roof of the next building. Kramer picks 
               himself up and
<b> 
</b>               sets off running again. Behind him, the cable guy comes to the 
               same gap, looks
<b> 
</b>               down at how far he has to fall, and thinks better of attempting 
               the leap.

<b>               
</b>               George sits on a bench with Marisa Tomei. He's mid-speech, and 
               Marisa's looking
<b> 
</b>               interested, smiling and laughing.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               ...So, anyway, if you think about it, 
               manure is not really that bad a
<b> 
</b>               word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front 
               of it, which is
<b> 
</b>               also good. Ma-newer , right?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARISA
</b>               (laughing) You're so right. I never

<b> 
</b>               'Ma' and the 'newer'.

<b>               
</b>               Marisa laughs and George is smiling happily.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARISA
</b>               Did you just make that up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b>               funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b>               Marisa laughs again, then speaks, still smiling, but more seriously.

<b> 
</b>               funny, how is it you're not taken?

               sort of engaged.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Marisa's face falls in disappointment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARISA

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm, you know, engaged.

<b>               
</b>               Marisa's expression turns to anger. She swings a fist and punches 
               George in the
<b> 
</b>               face, then grabs her bag and storms away. George feels the painful 
               spot where he
<b> 
</b>               received the blow.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               A few people stand around outside. The Seinfeld's Cadillac drives 
               up to the
