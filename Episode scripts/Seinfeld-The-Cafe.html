</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly 
               changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's 
               a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's 
               constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like 
               some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open 
               up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows 
               what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land 
               in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and 
               all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 
               'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'

</b>               (George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across 
               the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says 
               Grand opening.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always 
               think I'm nice, but women don't like 
               nice.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               This is amazing, I haven't seen one 
               guy going in to that restaurant since 
               it opened. Poor guy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society 
               we are living in, when nice is bad?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Little cologne.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Manly.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Monica wants me to wear it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So why didn't you say no?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm too nice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Poor guy. His family is probably in 
               Pakistan waiting him to send back money. 
               This is horrible.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She wants me to take an IQ test.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's because you're stupid enough 
               to wear the cologne.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, she's taking this course in education

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               taking the IQ test.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a 
               moron. You know, people think I'm smart, 
               but I'm not smart.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been

               gone through the trouble of helping

               mother was right. Of course I've never 
               had Pakistani food. How bad it could 
               be?

<b>               
</b>               It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional 
               good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, 
               your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, 
               masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people 
               to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, thanks 
               for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? 
               I'm renting here, I've got a security deposit. What am I supposed 
               to do?"
