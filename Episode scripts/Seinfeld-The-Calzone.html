<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I believe the doors on the bathroom 
               stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer 
               much by way of privacy. But I was thinking 
               if we extend the doors all the way to 
               the floors...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               All the way to the floor! What are you 
               crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your 
               lucky you have any doors at all. You 
               know when I was in the army... Hey Costanza. 
               What's that your eating over there? 
               It looks pretty tasty.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's a calzone, sir.

<b>               
</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Let's 
               have a look at at it. I want a little 
               taste. Come on, come on. Pass it down 
               here. That's a good boy. Okay. What's 
               in this thing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.

<b>               
</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               Eggplant. Yes. That's a hell of a thing. 
               Okay let's get back to business. Okay 
               here you go. Very good, very good. Excellent. 
               Excellent calzone you got there Costanza. 
               Okay a little jealous now. Okay let's 
               go. Ok last week.... You know that eggplant 
               was very good. Everybody out. I got 
               eggplant on my mind. Costanza get me 
               couple of those calzones right now. 
               Pronto. Move out. Big Stein wants an 
               eggplant calzone. Must have one. Everybody 
               out. Out.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short

               think so.

</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket 
               prevents it from dripping. The pita 
               pocket. (phone rings) What is it Watson? 
               A lost and found? No. I don't think 
               we need that. If people keel over because 
               they lost something that's there tough 
               luck. You got a drip on your mouth by 
               the way.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know a lost and found could be a 
               good idea.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               Hold on Watson. You like lost and found 
               George?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Definitely.

<b>               
</b><b>                       MR. STEINBRENNER
</b>               All right lost and found. But there's 
               got to be a time limit. We're not running 
               a pawn shop here.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move 
               without me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's very exciting.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So let me ask you a question about the 
               tip jar. I had a little
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in 
               the tip jar and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And 
               then when I am
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean 
               if they don't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               notice it what's the point.

               the movie part of the bet?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer leaves

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No. We were both in the mood for one.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know Elaine, It is not my way to 
               intrude on the personal lives of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               close fiends..

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh is that so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Absolutely. But I feel I must inform 
               you that what happened last
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               night was more than a simple bet.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What are you talking about?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. 
               He made a bet he knew he was
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               going to lose just to take you to dinner

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               If he wanted to ask me out why didn't 
               he just ask me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because if he doesn't ask you out he 
               doesn't get rejected. He has
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               found a dating loop hole.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't buy it.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Nothing. He walked me home.

               When I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate 
               the exact same
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread 
               bowl George
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               . First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing 
               more
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but 
               a table.
