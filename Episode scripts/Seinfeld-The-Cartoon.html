                           Written by

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Some street, Jerry and Kramer walking)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you're saying UNICEF is a scam?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's the perfect cover for a money laundering 
               operation. No one can keep track of all those
               kids with the little orange boxes of change.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               We see Sally from a distance.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; 
               she moved to New York a few years ago 
               . she's trying to become an actress.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hmmm, Dramatica comedia heh!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Untalented, She's always inviting me 
               to see her in some bad play in tiny 
               room without ventilation.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's really depressing.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She should just give up.

<b>               
</b>               She recognizes them.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Heeyyy!...

<b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my 
               shows. I just came back. Whooo.....I'm 
               on my way to an audition...
               still waiting for that big break.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Why don't you just give up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer!!!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               At least that's what Jerry says. Now 
               face it. If it hasn't happen it's not 
               gonna happen.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
<b>               
</b>               Kramer leaves both Sally and Jerry speechless

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So......Susan's dead.....

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               At Monk's

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I think she was happy someone finally 
               said it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why'd you have to say anything to her?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               'felt that the conversation was lagging.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why can't you ever keep your big mouth 
               shut?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I come in here to get a pleasant meal 
               and if we're not gonna have one I'll 
               grab a bite to eat at your
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               place.

<b>               
</b>               Pushes Jerry out of the booth and leaves.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, maybe Kramer is right, some 
               people should just give up . I have.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't remember , but it certainly 
               wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in 
               the New Yorker, I don't get
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               this.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't either.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And you're on the fringe of the humor 
               business.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George comes in

               here. We can figure this out. Now we 
               got a dog and a cat in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               an office.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It looks like my accountant's office 
               but there's no pets working there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               Elaine; Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me.
