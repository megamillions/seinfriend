<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It is pretty hard to justify, at this 
               point in history, the existence of men 
               and their
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, 
               and then put it back
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, 
               yup, I've got
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just 
               proud of anything
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that comes out of us? We actually have a monogram sewn on to 
               them. What is the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               source of pride here? We actually have it sticking out of the 
               breast pocket of our
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               jacket. "I have a snot rag."

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               We see a sad-looking George staring out at the ocean. Then cut 
               to the office of Mr.Lippman, where Elaine and Mr. Lippman are 
               toasting in champagne.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MR. LIPPMAN
</b>               To your promotion.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank 
               you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MR LIPPMAN
</b>               Well, you're really on your way now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine screams with joy and Mr. Lippman coughs violently.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You really oughtta do something about 
               that cold.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You got a raise?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't fool around, baby!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought you said Pendant was in financial 
               trouble.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               They were, but they're being absorbed 
               by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, when did that happen?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               They're signing the papers next week.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Does this mean they're gonna be publishing 
               Kramer's coffee table book?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, 
               plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

               about moving in together.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure 
               Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud 
               of you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Speaking of having it all ... Where 
               were you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange 
               looks )
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, the beach.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's not working, Jerry. It's just not 
               working.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What is it that isn't working?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why did it all turn out like this for 
               me? I had so much promise. I was personable, 
               I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically 
               speaking, but ... I was perceptive. 
               I always know when someone's uncomfortable 
               at a party. It became very clear to 
               me sitting out there today, that every 
               decision I've ever made, in my entire 
               life, has been wrong. My life is the 
               opposite of everything I want it to 
               be. Every instinct I have, in every 
               of life, be it something to wear, something 
               to eat ... It's all been wrong.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ( A waitress comes up to G )

<b>               
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always 
               have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked 
               out for me with tuna on toast. I want 
               the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken 
               salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup 
               of tea.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, there's no telling what can happen 
               from this.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know chicken salad is not the opposite 
               of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 
               'cos salmon swim against the current, 
               and the tuna swim with it.
<b>

</b>               Good for the tuna.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and 
               no money, who live with their parents, 
               don't approach strange women.

</b>               Well here's your chance to try the opposite. 
               Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated

               up to them.

               front office kind of thing. Assistant 
               to the travelling secretary. A job with 
               the New York Yankees! This has been 
               the dream of my life ever since I was 
               a child, and it's all happening because 
               I'm completely ignoring every urge towards 
               common sense and good judgment I've 
               ever had. This is no longer just some

               Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, 
               without this merger, we'd be out on 
               the street. Boy, they sure saved us.

               he probably needs because of his cold, and Elaine can't tell 
               him, 'cos she's got her mouth full of Jujyfruit...)

               sneezes, and realizes he doesn't have his handkerchief, but he 
               is forced to meet the Japanese, as they have already spotted 
               him and started talking to him )

               company.

</b>               Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage

               cake, coffee table, coffee table book, 
               clutches of people. Say what you want 
               about alcohol, but not only are there 
               not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol 
               actually helps you get rid of things. 
               Family, home, job, driver's license. 
               In fact, at a certain point, the only 
               thing you have to remember to get, is 
               more alcohol And maybe a rag for your 
               squeegee.
