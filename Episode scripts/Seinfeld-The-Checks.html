</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Street)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine come out of a drugstore. Elaine has a couple 
               of carrier bags
<b> 
</b>               she's fussing with the contents of.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, have you seen all these new commercials 
               for indigestion drugs?
<b> 
</b>               Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ugh, the whole country's sick to their 
               stomach.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now, you know you're supposed to take 
               these things before you get
<b> 
</b>               sick?

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine begin to walk along the street.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What is this, a 'bit'?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               'Cos I'm not in the mood.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We're just talking. Is this not the 
               greatest marketing ploy ever? If
<b> 
</b>               you feel good, you're supposed to take one!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They've opened up a whole new market. 
               Medication for the well.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (tired) Alright, are you done with your 
               little amusement?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It was okay, but move the 'medication 
               for the well' to the front, and
<b> 
</b>               hit the word 'good' harder.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (thinking) Great. Thanks.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Some Fancy Place)

<b>               
</b>               The room is stylishly furnished. A number of people sit around, 
               chatting and
<b> 
</b>               drinking. Elaine and her new boyfriend, Brett, walk across the 
               room, carrying
<b> 
</b>               drinks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, your firm designed all the furniture 
               in here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BRETT
</b>               We manufacture it. The original designs 
               are by Karl Farbman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine and Brett sit on a couch

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.

<b>               
</b><b>                             BRETT
</b>               You know Farbman?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Mm, love Farbman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BRETT
</b>               Most people go their whole lives without 
               sitting in a Farbman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) 
               Ahaha.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Music begins to play. It's The Eagles' Desperado. Brett hears 
               the music and
<b> 
</b>               is enraptured. He stares off into the distance, oblivious to 
               everything but
<b> 
</b>               the song.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed 
               shoes?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Brett hasn't heard a word of what Elaine said, continuing to 
               stare off into
<b> 
</b>               the distance.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Brett? Don't you think that would be 
               great?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Brett still doesn't react.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Brett?

<b>               
</b><b>                             BRETT
</b>               (still staring off) After the song, 
               babe.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Huh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             BRETT
</b>               The song.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by 
               his
<b> 
</b>               sensitivity.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Street)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine come round the corner, past the Chinese restaurant 
               and walk
<b> 
</b>               along the street.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So when do I meet this jerk?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works 
               with Karl Farbman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (dismissive) I dunno, some designer. 
               Anyway, Brett is so generous,
<b> 
</b>               and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What song?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Desperado.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Desperado?

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And you're still dating him? I tell 
               you who sounds a little desperado.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Ahead of the strolling twosome, a guy stands on the sidewalk, 
               twirling a
<b> 
</b>               brightly-coloured umbrella over his shoulder.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               When I started out as a comedian, I 
               sold umbrellas. It was my idea to

</b>               twirl it, to attract customers.

</b>               Jerry tosses his umbrella onto the couch, and walks toward the

               He reaches
<b> 
</b>               under himself and extracts it, then jumps again as he accidentally 
               opens it.

</b>               Jerry and Kramer draw level with three Japanese tourists. One 
               of them steps
<b> 
</b>               forward, holding out a camera.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry has spotted something further along the street. It's another 
               umbrella
<b> 
</b>               salesman, twirling his wares.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry walks along to the guy. Kramer fusses about, taking a picture 
               of the

</b>               three Japanese guys, at one point he steps back to frame them 
               all, and

               over toward
<b> 
</b>               Jerry, and thinks for a second.

               made at the
<b> 
</b>               end of Season 4. The Japanese are not looking impressed. George 
               is smiling
<b> 
</b>               and pointing, enthusiastically. On a coffee table sits a large 
               bowl

</b>               Jerry stands in front of the chest of drawers, holding a large 
               fireman's axe.

               wood

               the umbrella,
<b> 
</b>               and rushes forward to protect the furniture.

               of some
