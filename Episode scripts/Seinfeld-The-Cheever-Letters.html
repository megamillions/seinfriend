<b>                         THE CHEEVER LETTERS
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She hasn't told her father yet?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Susan wants me to be there.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're meetin' the father for the first 
               time?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Reluctantly) Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make 
               quite an impression on him when you 
               tell him how you burned his cabin down.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is 
               ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is 
               nice enough to give you a box of very 
               fine Cuban cigars..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, I know what happened.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, but wait, wait: And then you dump 
               them off onto Kramer..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Getting frustrated) I know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to 
               burn the man's cabin down with one of 
               those very same cigars! (Topping off 
               his observation) It's very comical..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing 
               today. I got a lot on my mind.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Persisting) No, no, we put this off 
               long enough. Today's the day.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Letting his conscious get the best 
               of him) I wonder how Susan's father's 
               going to react to this. Alright, what- 
               what's the worst he could do? So you 
               burn
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               a cabin down..

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house 
               - it's, like, a cabin.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We could build a cabin like (Snaps) 
               that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two 
               men could.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Looking over the writing materials 
               they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, 
               bics?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What, you got a problem with the pen 
               now?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I like a rolling writer. They're 
               very smooth.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright, let's just get to work. (They 
               both move into the living room - ready 
               to start writing their script. Jerry 
               sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. 
               Act I,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Scene A.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit 
               there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Wanting to get started) Just - just 
               park yourself. (George reluctantly sits 
               on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, no thank you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we 
               go.

<b>               
</b>               (A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes)
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. 
               (George turns the TV on, and begins 
               watching as Jerry dials the number) 
               Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. 
               Uh,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat 
               with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the 
               phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling 
               out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, 
               could you just put me through to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of 
               ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed 
               into the television. He seems to not
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get 
               through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear 
               for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               we're on for later?

<b>

</b>               (Cutting her off) I love that place. 
               My father built that cabin in 1947. 
               My mother was recuperating from Impetigo 
               at the time, and dad thought it would
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there 
               the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the 
               day. His last words to me were, (Mrs.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a 
               million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish 
               the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the 
               cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's 
               often been a.. sanctuary for me.

               to Lippman about my long distance calls 
               to Europe!

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

               then stops, looking at the door) Do 
               you smell smoke?

               It's really excellent.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of 
               his writing. (George shoots Jerry a 
               smirk, then returns to his book) Alright,

               gotta
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave

               my mother. She just bought me some new 
               panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting 
               in his chair) and they're - all laid
