<b>                       THE CHINESE RESTAURANT
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (A couple of days ago I used a public 
               phone), go over time on the call,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. 
               It's the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And 
               you got them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're 
               on the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a 
               few times, you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it 
               up, "Yeah,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... 
               D'you hear
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that 
               don't you?"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant)

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, they've just got to get more cops 
               on the force, it's as simple as
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Cops. I don't even care about cops. 
               I wanna see more garbage men. It's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage 
               cans and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least 
               be clean.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I tell you what they should do, they 
               should combine the two jobs, make
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around 
               with nothing to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch 
               a criminal, get
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right back to sweeping.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You should run for mayor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ehh, nobody listens.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Where is someone? I'm starving.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think this is him right here.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Is there a table ready?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RESTAURANT MANAGER
</b>               How many?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               How many?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Is Tatiana coming?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know, I have to call her, tell 
               her where we are. I'm very
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Really? I thought things were going 
<b>               OK.
</b><b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They were, it's kinda complicated.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well what is it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What do you wanna do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We might as well just stay here, we 
               haven't got that much time if we
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wanna make it to the movie.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               (George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it's this little place with this 
               little bathroom. It's like
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off 
               in an alcove.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool 
               around, and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin 
               to perceive this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to 
               surpass by great
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have 
               to stop. And as
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage 
               to momentarily...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable 
               force, I know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that 
               I know I'm
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               going to need...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               This could only happen to you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, 
               I hope you don't take this the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You said this to her after.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No. During.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, boy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wow! So...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So I'm dressing and she's staring up 
               at me, struggling to compute this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure 
               this woman,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse 
               she might
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, 
               and I'm very
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone 
               calls to get her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, 
               and she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I hate this place. I don't know why 
               we came here, I'm never coming back
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food 
               that you never
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a 
               delicious and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog 
               waiting for them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to fill up the trough.

</b>               Hunger will make people do amazing things. 
               I mean, the proof of that is               
               cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating 
               and, you               
               know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, 
               I mean, I               
               would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying 
               to get some very               
               deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, 
               (pretending to               
               wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody 
               there? What do               
               you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? 
               Get out of here!"
