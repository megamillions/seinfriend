<b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          (The street)
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Good shave today..
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          [wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry,
          I can manage these bags; really
          I'm
<b>          
</b>          fine.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns
          grow in a little..
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Can we rest here a second.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          [pause] Yeah, I guess.
<b>          
</b>          [She sits on the stairs of a small
          entryway.]
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          .. So how's Noreen?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Mm! She's got a new boyfriend:
          Paul.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Already? That was fast.. I assume
          he's not a High Talker..
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          No, but, he has, The Worst Habit.
          Whenever he answers the phone,
          he
<b>          
</b>          won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta
          go through, like, ten minutes of
<b>          
</b>          chit-chat.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          A Long Talker.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Yeah! But he is so boring! But
          now, whenever he answers the phone:
<b>          I
</b><b>          
</b>          just hang up.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          [pause] All right; let's move it
          out.
<b>          
</b>          [ELAINE gets her bags.]
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Hey, isn't that George's father?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say
          hello?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          I've never seen him in Manhattan
          before; it's weird. So out of context.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          That man he's with: is he wearing
          a cape?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          I believe he is wearing a cape.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Why is Mr. Costanza with a man
          in a cape?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Well, it is good cape weather.
          Cool. Breezy.
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       ELAINE          
</b>          Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape?
          Where do you even get a cape?
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          You're right; it is strange. In
          fact, let's cross to the other
          side of
<b>          
</b>          the street. Cover me.
<b>          
</b>          [ELAINE positions the bags to cover
          her face and upper body. JERRY
          walks
<b>          
</b>          by her so he's out of view, too.]
<b>

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          [JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's
          "house."]
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Just, ah, plop it on the counter
          there.
<b>          
</b>          [ELAINE drops one bag deliberately
          and throws the others on the counter.
<b>          
</b>          He hadn't helped her at all on
          the way--payback time. Then, during
          the
<b>          
</b>          following, she spends a lot of
          time looking for food in the bags
          and
<b>          
</b>          puts some in one bag--presumably
          hers.]
<b>          
</b>
<b>                       JERRY          
</b>          Oh! I got a message. [presses button

</b>          If I like their race, how can that

</b>          Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian

</b>
<b>                       ELAINE

</b>
<b>                       KRAMER
