<b>                       THE CIGAR STORE INDIAN
</b>


                             Written by

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry's standup piece.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You can always tell what was the best 
               year of your father's life, because
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it 
               out to the end,
<b> 
</b>               don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's 
               just they
<b> 
</b>               somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like 
               this fashion time
<b> 
</b>               capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a 
               pedestal, with
<b> 
</b>               someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To 
               me the worst thing
<b> 
</b>               is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that 
               little room. What
<b> 
</b>               men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants 
               at the door,
<b> 
</b>               and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would 
               be the best
<b> 
</b>               way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some 
               help?' 'No, just
<b> 
</b>               getting some air.'

<b>               
</b>               (George's parents' house)

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry in the living room.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How would you describe the smell in 
               this house?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (sniffing) Dandruff?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               There's some kasha.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap 
               carpeting. It's pot pourri,
<b> 
</b>               really.

<b>               
</b>               George enters from the kitchen (?).

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Alright, let's go, come on.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wha... you're going?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled 
               that last game, I'm gonna be
<b> 
</b>               late.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer enters from bathroom. He's holding some brightly coloured 
               objects in his
<b> 
</b>               hand and obviously has an unpleasant taste in his mouth.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Egh. These aren't candies.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Kramer. did you use those? These are 
               guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps
<b> 
</b>               and begins examining them for damage)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well I'm a guest.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Now my parents are gonna know I had 
               people over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're not allowed to have people over?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't have any parties while they're 
               out of town. (he leaves to return
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the soaps)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What, this is a party?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Not any more. Come on, get your ball, 
               we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry, Elaine and Kramer begin to leave. George re-enters and 
               notices Jerry's
<b> 
</b>               mug on the coffee table.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (yells) Wow! Who put this cup right 
               on the new table!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (picks it up) I was having coffee, I 
               put it on the coffee table.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, 
               you left a stain! (he runs to
<b> 
</b>               kitchen)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Whoah boy. There's always one at every 
               party, huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George returns with a cloth and begins wiping at the stain.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (impatient) Come on!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the big rush?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'm having people over.

               him holding

</b>               I was always excited as a kid, when 
               that new TV Guide would come. Somehow
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good 
               fresh TV shows
<b> 
</b>               in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. 
               All the shows
<b> 
</b>               stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being 
               sat on, thrown
<b> 
</b>               across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to 
               another person.
<b> 
</b>               It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' 
               (mimes
<b> 
</b>               throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, 
               they have a phone
<b> 
</b>               number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers 
               to the TV
<b> 
</b>               Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV 
               Guide crossword
<b> 
</b>               puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
