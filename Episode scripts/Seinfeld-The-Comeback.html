<b>                            THE COMEBACK
</b>


                             Written by

                      Gregg Kavet & Andy Robin

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Yankee Stadium, Conference Room)

<b>               
</b>               A group of staff, including George, are gathered round the table. 
               There's a bunch of food on the table. Most people have a small plate with 
               a few salad leaves on it in front of them. George is picking shrimp off a 
               platter, dipping them in some sort of sauce, and stuffing his face with 
               them, about as fast as he can manage.

<b>               
</b><b>                             BILL
</b>               Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, 
               I don't wanna be the one to tell him no.

<b>               
</b><b>                             REILLY
</b>               No-one in the park is gonna be able 
               to see it from there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, 
               why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?

<b>               
</b><b>                             REILLY
</b>               Hey George, the ocean called. They're 
               running outta shrimp.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Everyone at the table starts laughing uproariously at Reilly's 
               joke. George looks upset, and barely forces half a sick smile past his mouthful 
               of seafood.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George's Car)

<b>               
</b>               George drives along. He's fuming at Reilly's dig.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (angry, to himself) The ocean called. 
               Running outta shrimp. Outta  shrimp! (a thought occurs)
               Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! 
               (frustrated shout) Dammit!

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (New York Health & Racquet Club)

<b>               
</b>               George and Jerry come along a corridor. They're carrying bags 
               and paraphernalia indicating they've been playing tennis.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               'The ocean called, They're running outta 
               shrimp'?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to 
               him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk
<b> 
</b>               store called, and they're running outta you.'

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and George halt at a bench by the entrance to the pro shop. 
               Jerry rummages in his bag, producing an old-fashioned wooden framed 
               tennis racquet.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (smiling) Really? That's great. You 
               said that to him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (confessing) Well, actually, I thought 
               it up on the way over here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh. That's not quite the same.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No. No it's not. You don't know this 
               guy. It woulda been so sweet.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm gonna grab a can of balls.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right.

<b>               
</b>               George heads on down the corridor. Jerry walks into the pro shop, 
               carrying
<b> 
</b>               his gear. There are a few customers browsing. Milos (East European, 
               tracksuit
<b> 
</b>               wearing, slicked back hair with pony tail) comes over to Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MILOS
</b>               Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I need a can of balls.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry stands before the counter, holding the old-fashioned racquet. 
               Milos
<b> 
</b>               reaches under the counter and pulls out a can of tennis balls.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MILOS
</b>               Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Milos stops and stares disapprovingly at Jerry's racquet.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MILOS
</b>               ...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these 
               balls with that racquet, do you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry looks surprised.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Champagne Video)

<b>               
</b>               Inside a typical small video rental store, Elaine stands before 
               a rack marked
<b> 
</b>               'Staff Picks'. Individual shelves are labelled 'Elizabeth', 'Gene', 
               and
<b> 
</b>               'Vincent', amongst others. Elaine is reading the back of a video 
               box, when
<b> 
</b>               Kramer comes up behind her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. 
               (indicating shelf) This Vincent
<b> 
</b>               guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I 
               stick to the Gene rack.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all 
               these, so I went with a Kramer
<b> 
</b>               pick.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer holds up a video for Elaine's inspection.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. 
               Huh, I never heard of that
<b> 
</b>               one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, went straight to video.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks upon this as a negative.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (positive) That makes me the premiere.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer takes his cassette toward the counter.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (gets Kramer's point) Hah.

</b>               Kramer deposits the old wooden racquet in Jerry's trash. Jerry 
               notices

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry have been playing tennis at a different club 
               from the one we

</b>               saw earlier. They're packing away their stuff. At another court, 
               behind them,
<b> 
</b>               a guy in baseball cap and dark glasses is playing truly awful 
               tennis. He's
<b> 
</b>               missing the ball, falling over, flailing wildly with his racquet.
<b>

<b>               
</b>               Elaine sticks out her tongue at Jerry.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b>               his own hours.

<b>               
</b>               A tennis ball bounces by Elaine, and she grabs it. The terrible 
               player from
<b> 
</b>               the other court shouts over.

<b>               
</b>               The ball Elaine tossed back eludes the player's grasp, misses 
               his racquet and
<b> 
</b>               bounces away past him.

<b>               
</b>               The awful player comes over to get the ball back. As he approaches, 
               he
<b> 
</b>               removes his sunglasses and wipes his brow with his forearm.

<b>               
</b>               The player catches the ball and raises his head, so we can see 
               his face. It's
<b> 
</b>               Milos, the guy who sold Jerry his new racquet.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Milos looks guilty, and shouts across to his playing partner 
               as he walks away
<b> 
</b>               from Jerry.

</b><b>                             MILOS

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Milos bounces the ball on the court and tries to hit it over 
               the net. He
<b> 
</b>               fails, despite being no more than four feet from the net. Jerry 
               looks down at
<b> 
</b>               his new racquet, thoughtfully.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer enters the room, with a bowl of spaghetti. He sits on 
               the couch to
<b> 
</b>               watch the movie, and lifts a big forkful into his mouth.

</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer stops chewing and stares wide-eyed at the TV screen.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer continues to stare at the screen, stunned by the outcome

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Patty advances on Jerry, sexily. Jerry looks somewhat surprised.

<b> 
</b>               she breaks away.

</b><b>               
</b>               The woman pushes the door wide open, revealing Vincent standing 
               there.
<b> 
</b>               Vincent is a bespectacled, geeky, teen in a plaid shirt. He throws 
               his hands
<b> 
</b>               up to cover his face.

<b>               
</b><b>                             VINCENT
</b>               (shrieks) No, my acne!

<b>               
</b>               Vincent darts away from the door into the apartment. Elaine is 
               open-mouthed
<b> 
</b>               in surprise.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ahh-cnee.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WOMAN
</b>               (regarding the grocery bag) What d'you 
               have here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Vincent's mother grabs the top of the bag and begins to rummage 
               through the
<b> 
</b>               contents.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WOMAN
</b>               (disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. 
               (accusing) What kind of a
<b> 
</b>               sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (sick smile) We have the same taste 
               in movies.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WOMAN
</b>               Did he send you part of our VCR?

<b>               
</b>               Elaine smiles and nods, and pulls at a chain she has round her 
               neck. Threaded
<b> 
</b>               onto the chain is the VCR button Vincent sent her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Vincent's mother holds out her hand, and Elaine pulls the chain 
               over her head
<b> 
</b>               and hands it over.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WOMAN
</b>               (entering the apartment) Vincent!

<b>               
</b>               Elaine reaches into the grocery bag and extracts the bottle of 
               vodka. She
<b> 
</b>               drops the rest of the bag on the floor, and strolls away, swinging 
               the bottle
<b> 
</b>               like a club.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Tennis Club)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Milos are still playing. Jerry is still throwing the 
               game, and
<b> 
</b>               Milos is still milking it. Jerry puts an easy return straight 
               into the court
<b> 
</b>               in front of himself.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MILOS
</b>               (pointing and shouting) Look at the 
               big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to
<b> 
</b>               Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time 
               for you to
<b> 
</b>               be changed. (laughter) Hahah.

<b>               
</b>               Patty laughs too, with the few other spectators. Jerry looks 
               angry at this
<b> 
</b>               constant derision.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (quietly) I told you to cut it out.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry delivers a fierce serve which beats Milos, and almost hits 
               him in the
<b> 
</b>               face.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MILOS
</b>               (quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're 
               you doing? (to his audience)
<b> 
</b>               Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry walks back to deliver another serve. Kramer enters and 
               looks around for
<b> 
</b>               someone. On another court, Shellbach is facing an automatic serving 
               machine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (waving) Shellbach.

<b>               
</b>               Shellbach waves vaguely back to Kramer, who has begun to walk 
               round the room
<b> 
</b>               to get to him.

<b>               
</b>               Meanwhile, Jerry returns a shot to Milos, with some venom. Milos 
               stretches
<b> 
</b>               desperately to try and reach it, but loses his grip on his racquet. 
               The
<b> 
</b>               racquet arcs across the hall, watched by Patty, and then spotted 
               by Kramer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Racquet.

<b>               
</b>               The racquet plummets from the air and strikes the guy who is 
               operating the
<b> 
</b>               automatic serving machine for Shellbach. The guy is knocked unconscious 
               and,
<b> 
</b>               as he falls, he pushes against the machine, turning it to point 
               at Kramer.
<b> 
</b>               Kramer stands transfixed, as it continues to launch balls at 
               him. Several
<b> 
</b>               balls in rapid succession strike him in the head, until he slumps,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               unconscious, to the floor.

<b>               
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               A boardroom very much like that of the Yankees, but with a Firestone 
               sign on
<b> 
</b>               the wall. Several people sit around the table, including Reilly, 
               and George,
<b> 
</b>               who is filling his face from a large dish of shrimp.

<b>               
</b><b>                             REILLY
</b>               So, George. You're proposing a snow

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b>               (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, 
               I brought
<b> 
</b>               enough for everybody.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MCADAM
</b>               (doubtful) I have to say this, this

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of sense.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               shrimp) Let's see how many I can
<b> 
</b>               fit in my mouth.

<b>               
</b>               George begins picking up shrimp one by one and stuffing them 
               into his mouth.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             REILLY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George looks up, expectantly.

</b><b>                             REILLY
</b>               The ocean called. They're running outta 
               shrimp.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Everyone around the table laughs. Except for George, who looks 
               triumphant. He
<b> 
</b>               swallows, and uses a napkin to clean his fingers.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly)

<b>               
</b>               Reilly and everyone else laughs even more than they did before. 
               George looks
<b> 
</b>               angry and frustrated, even on the verge of tears for a second, 
               then something
<b> 
</b>               occurs to him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George looks round, smiling arrogantly, expecting laughter. But 
               there is a
<b> 
</b>               deep, uncomfortable, silence. Reilly, looks stony-faced. McAdam 
               stands and
<b> 
</b>               leans over to speak in George's ear.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MCADAM
</b>               His wife is in a coma.

<b>               
</b>               George looks sick.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Hospital Room)

<b>               
</b>               Kramer lies in bed, asleep. Jerry sits in a chair, reading a 
               newspaper.
<b> 
</b>               There's a knock at the door and Elaine enters, carrying a VCR.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He's been sleeping a lot. He's still 
               groggy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a 
               movie might cheer him up. I got

</b>               him a Gene pick.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

               around) Uh, outlet?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry points to the wall beside Kramer's bed.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine walks over and sees both sockets are full. She takes hold 
               of one of
<b> 
</b>               the plugs and yanks it out of the socket with a grunt. The grunt 
               wakes
<b> 
</b>               Kramer, who looks groggily around and sees Elaine standing holding 
               the plug,
<b> 
</b>               as if she's just unplugged his life support. He stares, bug-eyed 
               and shrieks
<b> 
</b>               in terror.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Once again, George drives along, frustrated and angry.

<b>               
</b>               He tails off, as he can't think of anywhere to go. Then a look 
               of
<b> 
</b>               enlightenment comes to George's face, as he thinks of something.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               D'ohh!

<b>               
</b>               George looks gutted for a second, then a determined expression 
               comes to his

</b>               face. He swings the car round with a squeal of tires, and heads 
               back towards

</b>               the airport.
