               lunch)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You, anybody - whatever. You're in the 
               little room, you're chained to the floor, 
               you're there for a long time.. do you 
               think they would ever consider doing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               the laundry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's 
               in the Geneva Convention.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

               Take off your socks, your pants, your 
               underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! 
               Take it off, take it off!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George 
               slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, Georgie.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY AND ELAINE
</b>               Hi.

<b>               
</b>               (George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (To George) What's the matter?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught 
               me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "Caught" you? Doing what?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know. (All three give him blank 
               stares) I was alone..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Nods) Uh-huh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (Laughing) She caught you?

<b>               
</b>               (Elaine laughs with Kramer)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Where?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I 
               stopped by the house to drop the car 
               off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. 
               Nobody was there - they're supposed
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying 
               the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing 
               through it..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "Glamour"?

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               ..So, one thing lead to another..

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, what did she do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               First she screams, "George, what are 
               you doing?! My God!" And it looked like 
               she was gonna faint - she started clutching 
               the wall, trying to hang onto it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRMAER
</b>               (Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I didn't know whether to try and keep 
               her from falling, or zip up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What did you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I zipped up!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Wide-eyed) So, she fell?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to 
               be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, 
               I couldn't run over there the way I 
               was!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I guess you couldn't have..

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, 
               smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Finishing it off) ..done that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So, she fell, and then she started screaming, 
               "My back! My back!" So, I picked her 
               up and took her to the hospital.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Between chuckles) How is she?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's not funny, Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Her back went out. She's gotta be there 
               for a couple of days. All she said on 
               the way over in the car was, "Why, George, 
               why?!".. I said, "Because it's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               there!"

<b>

</b>               (Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She 
               checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, 
               obviously upset, is putting her coat

</b>               No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually 
               started with George and his mother-

</b><b>                             MARLA
</b>               I don't want to hear another word. And 
               to think how close I came to you being 
               the one! I must have been out of my 
               mind.

</b><b>               
</b>               (She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs 
               his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in 
               his chair, staring at the woman)

</b>               (Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her, trying 
               to hail a taxi)

               with you or your perverted friends. 
               (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, 
               get away from me! You're horrible.
<b>

               crying, and he was consoling her, and 
               then, she, uh, just got into his car, 
               and they just drove away.
