</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know doctor is supposed to be such 
               a prestigious occupation. But
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it's really like one of the only jobs where you have to have 
               your diploma
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn't 
               it? "I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               really am a doctor you know. You think I'm not, just check it 
               out." I don't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage 
               over us all the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, 
               and I'll
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants 
               on seems
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               like they know what they're talking about. In any difference 
               of opinion,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pants always beats no-pants.

</b>               (Commercial)

<b>               
</b>               At a restaurant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Can I say one word to you? Lobster. 
               The lobster here is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>               Twenty five dollars.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking 
               about the price. You know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you're the only woman I've never thought about the price. Get 
               the lobster. I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>               George, George, uh, I think we have 
               to talk. I think we
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have a problem.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>               We can't keep seeing each other.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>               (crying) Because it's over. *sob, sob,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               parents, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you 
               ever forgive me?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               *sob*

</b><b>                             WAITER

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND
</b>               (crying) Yes. I'll have the lobster.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Um, you know I'm starting to think that 
               maybe lobster isn't the way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to go.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Then he asked you out?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We started to talk, and I told him that

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hand on my heart.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Outside on a sidewalk.

<b>               
</b>               A woman is waiting for a cab. Kramer walks up to her.

<b>

<b>

<b>               
</b>               Church music plays.

<b>               
</b>               George is dressed in a white church gown.

<b>               
</b>               He walks down the church aisle carrying a candle.

<b>               
</b>               Father-priest says some Latvian words.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer is running down the street going to the church.

<b>               
</b>               The church music is still playing.

<b>               
</b>               George takes a drink of some wine. He spills some on his gown. 
               He makes a

</b>               hand motion on his gown.

<b>
