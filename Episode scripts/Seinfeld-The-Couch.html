<b>                             THE COUCH

</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The love seat, that's a nice little 
               item, there...I guess some guy
<b> 
</b>               thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why 
               not just shorten the
<b> 
</b>               furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. 
               This is very flattering to
<b> 
</b>               the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it 
               the 'half-conscious deadbeat
<b> 
</b>               with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? 
               I mean, it goes back
<b> 
</b>               so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's 
               over! You're wiped!'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry and George in a furniture store. Jerry is shopping for 
               a new couch.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, she got you to join a book club?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter 
               than you pretty soon.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I think that statement alone reflects 
               your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits 
               on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nah, I don't like that one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, what's your first book?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               "Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. 
               (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's kinda old, isn't it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They wanted to read a Truman Capote 
               book.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, sure...Truman Capote.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He's a great writer.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Did you ever read anything by him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. You?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, what about this one? Look at this, 
               this is it! This is what I'm looking 
               for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. The moving guys are delivering 
               Jerry's new couch.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, what's going on?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               New couch, baby!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               New couch? Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I love this couch. You know what the 
               best part about it is? It doesn't fold 
               out, so no one can sleep over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Elaine laughs. Carl and another furniture mover come in, and 
               they pick up Jerry's old couch.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             CARL

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, let me get the door for you. (They 
               carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, 
               be careful!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wait till you see it, it's perfect. 
               The guy told me it's one of a kind, 
               they stopped making it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, I'll take it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I'm sure that they can deliver 
               it to your apartment.
<b> 
</b><b>

               into business together. Remember that 
               idea I had a few years ago about the 
               pizza place where you make your own 
               pizza?

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's a pizza place where you make your 
               own pie! We give you the dough, the 
               sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap 
               it, you flip it up into the air...you 
               put your toppings on and you slide it 
               into the oven! Sounds good, huh?

               New York Magazine just judged his kitchen

               night when I was ten years old. She 
               was sent to a slave labor camp, where 
               she labored for twelve years. Finally, 
               they released her and she was on a boat 
               to America to re-unite with us...but 
               she was served some bad fish, and she 
               died...on the high seas.

               head and goes into the other room. George 
               gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. 
               Let's go.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             REMY
</b>               It's not your seat.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I was sitting there, c'mon.

</b><b>                             REMY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               to squeeze into the corner seat of the 
               couch and struggles with Remy. He spills 
               his glass of grape juice all over the 
               couch in the process.)
<b> 
</b><b>

               George with his hands on his hips.)
