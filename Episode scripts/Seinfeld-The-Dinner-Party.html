<b>                           THE DINNER PARTY
</b>

<b>               
</b>               We never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. 
               Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. I can't 
               believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my 
               coffee! I think we all would have been a lot happier if they 
               hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make 
               a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised 
               they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense 
               to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, "That's one small 
               step for man, one giant leap for every, complaining, sob on the 
               face of the earth. "

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This week. My father got a deal from 
               a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You 
               know about Gore-Tex?
<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Maybe we should stop off on the way 
               and get a bottle of wine or something.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               These people invited us for dinner. 
               We have to bring something.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Because it's rude, otherwise.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You mean just going there because I'm

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you're telling me instead of being 
               happy to see me they're going to be 
               upset because I didn't bring anything. 
               You see what I'm saying?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The fabric of society is very complex

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You can't bring Pepsi.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why not?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Because we're adults?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You telling me that wine is better than 
               Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than 
               Pepsi.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm telling you George, I don't think 
               we want to walk in there and put a big 
               plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.

               time there is a dinner invitation there's 
               this annoying little chore that goes 
               along with it.

               I heard a weather man say that 75% of your body heat is 
               actually lost through the top of the top of the head. 
               Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat. 
               But there's no hat that makes a statement quite like a hat with a flap. 
               The hat with the flaps makes a statement like no other hat makes. This hat 
               says to the world "I would rather have the heat in my skull rather than 
               anything society could possibly offer." In fact I would say if you're on 
               trial for a serious crime and you lawyer recommends the insanity defense, 
               this is the hat to wear. Your lawyer should insist on it. 

               [puts on the hat] Your honor, "The defense rests."
