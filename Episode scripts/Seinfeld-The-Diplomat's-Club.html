</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's this little scam the airlines 
               have goin' now with these special clubs? 
               Hundred fifty dollars a year to sit 
               in a room, eat peanuts, drink coffee 
               and soda, and read magazines. Excuse 
               me, but isn't this the flight? I already 
               got four hours of this comin' to me... 
               What am I paying for? How bout' an 'I 
               got all my luggage club'? Can I get 
               into that club? Where is that club? 
               I would like to join that club. Airlines 
               love to divide us into classes. You 
               know like when you're sitting in coach, 
               the stewardess always closes that stupid 
               curtain. Always gives you that look, 
               like, maybe if you would work a little 
               harder...

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What time does your flight get in? Six? 
               All right, that gives us six hours. 
               Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's 
               club. I'll be the one without the big 
               red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs 
               up)

</b><b>                             JERRY

               but I got six hours.

               I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget

</b>               Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going 
               to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him 
               that I am quitting.

</b>               Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early 
               this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove 
               through a residential backyard and wound 
               up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New 
               York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, 
               seemed a little freaked out.
