<b>                              THE DOG
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to 
               be making up some
<b> 
</b>               time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll 
               just make up
<b> 
</b>               time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. 
               Of course, when
<b> 
</b>               they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing 
               the speed of the
<b> 
</b>               aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't 
               you just go as
<b> 
</b>               fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, 
               nail it. Give it
<b> 
</b>               some gas! We're flying!

<b>               
</b>               New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative 
               (and inebriated)
<b> 
</b>               man.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Travelling, of course, is the best education. 
               Do you know last year I
<b> 
</b>               was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone 
               to more but I had
<b> 
</b>               just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now 
               I won't travel
<b> 
</b>               without him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Is he on the plane now?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the 
               baggage compartment. I don't
<b> 
</b>               know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better 
               behaved than
<b> 
</b>               most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have 
               any pets?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, just my next door neighbor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               You're missing out on a relationship 
               that could enrich your life in ways
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that you never could have thought possible.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Howbout picking up their, you know. 
               You find that enriching?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the matter?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.

<b>               
</b>               Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the 
               cabin where
<b> 
</b>               flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT #1
</b>               Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing 
               in Chicago and get you
<b> 
</b>               to a hospital.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               My dog. What about my dog?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT #1
</b>               Uh, you have a dog?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT #2
</b>               Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. 
               Palone?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry stares out the window.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Jerry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Huh? How you feeling?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Would you take care of Farfel?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Farfel?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT #2
</b>               It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago 
               to get him to a hospital,
<b> 
</b>               could you take his dog to New York?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GAVIN

</b>               The dog?

<b>               
</b>               New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up 
               and there's a
<b> 
</b>               loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel 
               are playing
<b> 
</b>               'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b>               Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal 
               in the house!
<b> 
</b>               He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Am I supposed to ruin the whole night

</b>               mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control 
               all these

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>               
</b>               of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is

<b> 
</b>               let's just go.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know it's interesting, because I

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you were released on Monday.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAVIN
</b>               Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was 
               taken to the Bell's Palsy Center
<b> 
</b>               in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top

<b>               
</b>               I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that 
               I really enjoyed.
<b> 
</b>               We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and 
               my mother had
<b> 
</b>               built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt 
               this gives you
<b> 
</b>               a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design 
               principle that a
<b> 
</b>               mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What 
               kind of a jerk
<b> 
</b>               walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother 
               room in there.
<b> 
</b>               There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet 
               will fall for
<b> 
</b>               this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, 
               BANG! With his
<b> 
</b>               little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, 
               even if he
<b> 
</b>               thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try 
               to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
