</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry is just now getting done with his act)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, 
               sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed 
               woman runs up and hugs him - taking 
               Jerry by surprise)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               Jerry!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               (Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! 
               (Sees Jerry's expression - he still 
               has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' 
               roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs 
               slightly)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you 
               saw the show?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for 
               the free tickets. You are so funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Modest) Oh, thanks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               (Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're 
               very funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Blunt) I believe you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. 
               I am taking you (Points to him) out 
               to dinner.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I 
               can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought 
               we'd really get along - I guess because 
               we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You 
               know what, um.. (Turns around, picking 
               up a large gift from a table) You have 
               to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. 
               (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles 
               under the size of it) It's a wedding 
               present.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             SALLY
</b>               And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? 
               Be very careful.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh-huh.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (The Coffee shop)

<b>               
</b>               (George and his father, Frank, are sitting at a booth)

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               George, as you may be aware, your mother 
               and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, 
               Florida.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               So, I was wondering, would it be okay 
               if I turned your room into a billiard 
               parlor?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             FRANK

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Elaine enters. George spots her in mid-sentence)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, that's.. Elaine!

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Trying to come up with an excuse not 
               to sit with them) Actually, I gotta 
               get to the.. uh.. thing.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               So.. (Trying to think up something to 
               talk about) Frank, did George ever show 
               you that photo?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, the photo I took in Tuscany 
               of the little man in front of the sign 
               that said "Costanza"?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? 
               (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did 
               you talk to him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I didn't talk to anyone - I was just 
               walking by, and I saw the sign, and 
               I thought George might get a kick out 
               of it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               I gotta get that picture - it could 
               be my cousin, Carlo.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Who is that?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Muttering out, not really wanting to 
               talk about his family) When the Costanzas 
               came here, one brother stayed behind.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               I played with him every day until the 
               age of four - and then we separated.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               No. That's why I can never be president.. 
               It always irked me. That's why, even 
               at an early age, I had no interest in 
               politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling 
               out) They don't want me, I don't want 
               them!

</b>               I want to know why you took my doll 
               out of the house.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I just wanted a second opinion.

<b>               
</b>               (There's a knock at the door. George sighs, then answers it - 
               it's Frank)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (Holding up the picture) Take a look 
               at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh 
               and blood? Of course, your mother- (His 
               attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. 
               Like George did earlier, he starts to 
               imagine that the doll is scolding him 
               as his wife would)

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DOLL
</b>               Oh, stop bothering everybody with that 
               picture. It's ridiculous!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! 
               I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles 
               with Susan for possession of the doll) 
               Come here!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SUSAN

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Frank manages to get the doll from Susan. He twists the head 
               clean off the body)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (Holding out the head in his hand, he 
               addresses it) There! Now what have you 
               got to say for yourself?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (To Susan) I told you it looked like 
               her..

</b>               (A street in Tuscany)

<b>               
</b>               (Frank meets up with a man sweeping the sidewalk - the man he 
               believes to be his cousin)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! 
               It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the 
               guy, but he resists - pushing Frank 
               away. He scolds Frank in another language) 
               I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?

</b>               (Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. 
               (Picking up his present) I guess I was 
               wrong. (Walks off)
