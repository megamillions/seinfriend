</b>               They call themselves exterminators but 
               they can't really do it. The best they 
               can do is get the bugs to somebody else's 
               house. They just relocate them , y'know 
               what I mean, they're bug realtors is 
               what they are. Ahmmmm.. I'll think you'll 
               be happy here , there's a lotta crumbs 
               not much light, ahmmm they usually sleep 
               through the night, so you'll really 
               have a (?) of the place. Nobody really 
               cares about killing insects, even the 
               animal rights people don't care. You 
               could probably walk into an animal rights 
               organization meeting and hear a speech 
               like; The only way to stop the cruelty 
               of the scientific testing on animals 
               is (slaps his face)...Ha! Got him , 
               is to boycott these companies.

</b>               You know Newman , the thing about fleas 
               is that they irritate the skin and they 
               start to...itch.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because 
               they're crawling , crawling on your skin.
