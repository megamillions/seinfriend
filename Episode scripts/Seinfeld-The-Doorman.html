</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You remember a few years ago in New 
               York, we had the doorman strike? They 
               have a union, in the fancy buildings, 
               and they went out on strike. Now you 
               wouldthink, if any group of people would 
               not wanna demonstrate what life would 
               be like without them, it would be doormen. 
               (as belligerent doorman) "Let's see 
               how they do without us!" There's no 
               doorman, people open the door, they 
               walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna 
               walk out next? The guys who clean your 
               windshield at the traffic light, with 
               the dirty rag? (as window washer) "We 
               demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry comes in from the street and walks toward the elevators. 
               A doorman, stood
<b> 
</b>               reading a newspaper on a counter, objects. There's an undertone 
               to the doorman's
<b> 
</b>               voice - unfriendly, contemptuous, even an edge of menace.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns 
               to Jerry) May I help you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm 
               just going up to see Elaine Benes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               (unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward 
               Jerry) No-one here by that
<b> 
</b>               name.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for 
               Mr. Pitt.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               Oh. House-sitting, mmm.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               What're you, the boyfriend? Here for 
               a... quickie?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Can I just go up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               Oh, I get it. Why waste time making 
               small talk with the doorman? I
<b> 
</b>               should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The doorman wanders back to his newspaper. Jerry shrugs and pushes 
               the button
<b> 
</b>               for one of the elevators. There's a pause as he waits for it 
               to arrive. The
<b> 
</b>               doorman stands holding his paper, staring at Jerry, with the 
               unfriendly smile on
<b> 
</b>               his face. Jerry throws a smile of his own back. The elevator 
               is still not
<b> 
</b>               moving. Jerry tries to break the uncomfortable silence.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How 'bout those Knicks?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               Oh, I see. On the sports page...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               ...What makes you think I wasn't reading 
               the Wall Street page? Oh, I
<b> 
</b>               know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry turns away and looks at the indicator, hoping that the 
               elevator will come
<b> 
</b>               and rescue him.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Street)

<b>               
</b>               George and Kramer walk along together.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So, you think your parents'll get back 
               together?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I hope so. I can't take him living with 
               me much longer. He makes this
<b> 
</b>               kasha, it stinks up the whole house.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer has noticed a 'Sightseeing Tour' bus on the street, with 
               a German flag
<b> 
</b>               painted on the door. It gives him an idea. Kramer steps in front 
               of George and
<b> 
</b>               brings them to a halt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, George, stick 'em up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               For these German tourists. Pretend that 
               I'm robbing you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So these people can go back home and 
               tell their friends they saw a real
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer pushes his hand deep into a pocket and raises his arm, 
               giving the
<b> 
</b>               impression that he has a gun concealed beneath his coat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Awright, hands up, porky!

<b>               
</b>               On the tourist bus, the occupants attention is attracted. They 
               look out the
<b> 
</b>               window at the 'mugging'. George has his hands up, and Kramer 
               is feeling through
<b> 
</b>               George's pockets with his free hand.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got 
               it in here, huh, fat boy!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The tourist are looking out of the bus. Shocked, they knock on 
               the glass. Kramer
<b> 
</b>               grabs George by the collar of his jacket and is shaking him violently.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? 
               Is that all you got?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright, that's enough.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I'll tell you when it's enough! (he 
               releases George) Alright, now you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!

<b>               
</b>               Kramer walks away. The tourists stare, horrified at what they've 
               witnessed.

</b>               George and Kramer stand together, by George's computer. Frank 
               unfastens his
<b> 
</b>               shirt and opens it. Kramer and George turn and see Frank's torso 
               exposed as the
<b> 
</b>               shirt comes off. Kramer's eyebrows go up in surprise. George 
               looks horrified,
<b> 
</b>               and puts his hand to his mouth like he's going to vomit.

</b>               Jerry picks up a paper sack of empty bottles from the floor by 
               the desk.

<b>               
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Jerry emerges from the elevator (without the bottles). There 
               is a new doorman on
<b> 
</b>               duty, who gives Jerry a friendly nod and smile and holds the 
               door open for him.
<b> 
</b>               Jerry nods and smiles back, and leaves.

<b>

               out on the
<b> 
</b>               floor in front of her and is going through it for Mr. Pitt's

               a familiar
<b> 
</b>               figure. The doorman still has the attitude problem.

               with those things clanging

</b>               around. He should wear something for support.

</b>               A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about

</b>               Kramer leaves. A buxom blonde woman in a purple shirt is making 
               her way to the
<b> 
</b>               door, as she passes the booth she notices George.

</b>               The woman smiles and leaves. Elaine enters Monk's and comes over 
               to Jerry. She's
<b> 
</b>               not happy about something.

</b>               Yes, we do.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks over at George, wondering what he's doing. George 
               is holding the
<b> 
</b>               neck of his shirt open, and is peering down the inside of the 
               garment at his
<b> 
</b>               chest. As Elaine and Jerry watch, George jiggles his upper body, 
               to see if
<b> 
</b>               there's any movement.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What is wrong with George?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He's... trying to get something off 
               his chest.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George ends his experiment, and rises to leave. He digs in his 
               wallet to pay the
<b> 
</b>               cheque.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (agitated) Alright, I gotta try and 
               talk my mother into taking him off

</b><b>

</b>               (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry enters from the street, only to find the unpleasant doorman 
               standing
<b> 
</b>               inside the lobby. The doorman's demeanour hasn't improved.

<b>

</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               I traded shifts with the night doorman. 
               He had some personal affairs to

</b>               attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each

</b><b>               
</b>               a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking 
               to them. I'd

</b><b>                             DOORMAN
</b>               It's not brain surgery. You open the 
               door for people who live here.
<b> 
</b>               And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his 
               hat) Here.
<b> 
</b>               (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh.

<b>               
</b>               The doorman goes out the door. Jerry takes off the hat, which 
               he's not thrilled
<b> 
</b>               about wearing, and leans on the counter. The doors of an elevator 
               open, and a
<b> 
</b>               young woman pushing a baby buggy emerges and heads for the exit. 
               After a second,
<b> 
</b>               Jerry realises his job. He puts on the hat and opens the door 
               to allow the woman
<b> 
</b>               to leave. AS he opens the door, a man enters and strolls past 
               Jerry into the
<b> 
</b>               elevator vacated by the woman.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. 
               Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The man takes no notice of Jerry, the doors close. The street 
               door opens and
<b> 
</b>               another, older guy, enters. Jerry moves and challenges him.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             MR. GREEN
</b>               (indignant) Of course I live here. I've 
               lived here for twenty years.
<b> 
</b>               Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and 
               have you arrested.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry steps aside and motions for the guy to carry on into the 
               building, but he
<b> 
</b>               looks resentful about it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (after the guy) You think you're better

<b>               
</b>               George is riding the bus. As the vehicle travels along the street, 
               it rattles,
<b> 
</b>               shakes and shudders like all poorly maintained public transport. 
               George is
<b> 
</b>               strap-hanging, and he gets a worried look as he feels there might 
               be some
<b> 
</b>               movement on his chest. He puts his hands on his chest, then notices 
               another guy
<b> 
</b>               on the buss looking at him. Self-consciously, George pulls his 
               coat tight shut,
<b> 
</b>               and crosses his arms firmly.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is standing behind the counter, reading the doorman's newspaper. 
               A FedEx
<b> 
</b>               delivery guy enters with a package, lays it on the counter and 
               scans a barcode
<b> 
</b>               on it with a little device he takes from his pocket. Jerry watches,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               disinterested. There is a brief pause, as the FedEx guy waits 
               for something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DELIVERY GUY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, right.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry takes the FedEx guy's pen and signs for the package, then 
               goes back to the
<b> 
</b>               newspaper.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DELIVERY GUY
</b>               (with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those 
               Knicks, huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry gives the guy a hostile look, much as the doorman might.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

<b>               
</b>               The FedEx guy leaves, looking a touch unhappy at Jerry's attitude. 
               Jerry puts
<b> 
</b>               the paper down, and goes to have a look through the door. There's 
               no sign of the
<b> 
</b>               doorman, so Jerry tosses the hat onto the counter, dismissing 
               it with a wave of
<b> 
</b>               the hand as he moves to the elevator.

               record player.

               Mrs. Payton) at

</b>               the exact same time the couch was stolen.

<b>               
</b>               Mrs. Payton and the doorman both look at Elaine. Elaine looks 
               sick, as she's
<b> 
</b>               caught out.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b>               how to do anything.

<b>               
</b>               The doorman walks silently away with the package and a quiet 
               smile of triumph.

</b>               the restaurant. With your friend.

<b>               
</b>               Poppie holds his hands out, indicating someone of Elaine's height. 
               Jerry nods,
<b> 
</b>               remembering and in sympathy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             POPPIE
</b>               She start the big fight, about abortion.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine comes back over to Jerry and the couch. Poppie spots her 
               approach, and is
<b> 
</b>               not happy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             POPPIE
</b>               It's you! It's you!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wha...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             POPPIE
</b>               You! I... I gotta sit down!

<b>               
</b>               Poppie, aggravated, moves toward the couch.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, Poppie! No!!

<b>               
</b>               Poppie sinks onto the couch, despite the pleas, and horrified 
               expressions, of
<b> 
</b>               Jerry and Elaine.

<b>               
</b>               (George's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               George sits up in bed reading a magazine. Frank enters, carrying 
               a small bowl.
<b> 
</b>               George puts his magazine to one side, as Frank carefully climbs 
               into bed whilst
<b> 
</b>               keeping hold of the bowl. George takes off his glasses, as Frank 
               settles back.
<b> 
</b>               Picking up a spoon from the bowl Frank is about to eat, when 
               a thought occurs.
<b> 
</b>               Carefully, Frank reaches over with the spoon, to offer George 
               a taste.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               Kasha?

<b>               
</b>               George looks disdainfully at the spoonful. A few morsels have 
               fallen onto the
<b> 
</b>               bedclothes, George picks them up and puts them back into Frank's 
               bowl.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No. Thanks, dad.

<b>               
</b>               Wearily, George puts his glasses on the bedside table, and switches 
               off his bedside lamp, bringing darkness to the room. George shuffles 
               down beneath the bedclothes, to get comfortable, just as Frank switches
               on his bedside lamp.
<b> 
</b>               Exasperated, George lifts his pillow and places it over his own 
               face, as Frank continues to eat his kasha.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                              THE END
