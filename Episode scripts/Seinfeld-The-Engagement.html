</b>               Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell 
               you what your problem is: You brought 
               your queen out too fast. What do you 
               think? She's one of these feminists 
               looking to get out of the house? No, 
               the queen is old fashioned. . Likes 
               to stay home. Cook. Take care of her 
               man. Make sure he feels good.

</b>               And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat

</b>               I don't see how I could perform sexually 
               in a situation after something like 
               that. I was completely emasculated. 
               Anyway, it's not the only reason.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right. You wanna know what one of 
               her favorite expressions is? Happy, 
               Pappy?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased 
               with something, she'll say, "Happy, 
               Pappy?"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm much more comfortable criticizing 
               people behind their backs. Anyway, look 
               who's talking. You just broke up with 
               with Melanie last week because she "shuushed 
               you" while you were watching TV.

               We were practically in Monticello. I 
               mean, how could that thing have found 
               its way back? There's no way.
