</b>


                             Written by

                             Steve Koren




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Subway Train)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine sit side by side on a subway train. They're 
               both reading
<b> 
</b>               newspapers, when something occurs to Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know at the movies, they show that 
               little ad for the concession
<b> 
</b>               stand?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Where the cartoon candy's dancing and 
               the Milk Dud's playing the
<b> 
</b>               banjo?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He's wailing on that banjo.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I just don't understand the raisinettes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               The sax player?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The box of raisinettes runs up to the 
               concession stand, buys another
<b> 
</b>               box of raisinettes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Box of raisinettes eating another box 
               of raisinettes? It's perverse.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 
               'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not 
               having children.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He's a musician.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Musicians. Get a real job.

<b>               
</b>               They shrug and return to their reading.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Monk's)

<b>               
</b>               George is sitting at the counter perusing a magazine. The waitress 
               comes over
<b> 
</b>               to take his order.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               What d'you want?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ah, I've had everything on the menu. 
               Uh, surprise me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The waitress disappears out back. George goes back to reading. 
               Behind him, a
<b> 
</b>               beautiful woman enters, and approaches him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               (to George) Neil.

<b>               
</b>               The woman touches George on his shoulder, to get his attention.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               Neil.

<b>               
</b>               George turns to face the woman.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               (apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling 
               broadly) I'm supposed to meet
<b> 
</b>               my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (bemused) Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               (smiling) Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (pointing to himself) Like me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               Uh-huh. Sorry.

<b>               
</b>               Danielle walks away with a wave. George sits there, looking stunned.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (confused, to himself) Like me? But 
               how?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The waitress returns from the back and puts a plate down on the 
               counter
<b> 
</b>               before George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, yes, I am.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry has a suitcase on the table, packing for a trip. Kramer 
               has brought in
<b> 
</b>               a large paper bag, from which he pulls a blue t-shirt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Look what I got for you, for your Florida 
               trip. Crazy Shirts was
<b> 
</b>               closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer holds the shirt up against Jerry and admires it. On the 
               front of the
<b> 
</b>               shirt is the legend '#1 DAD'.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.

</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY

               in medium. Perfect.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               can my cigar guy drop off

</b>               some Cubans for me at your parents' house?

               with Neil.
<b> 
</b>               Neil is clearly bald, but has his back to the camera.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry 
               Neil, it's over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Neil's head drops at this news.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               Come on, let's just eat our crepes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The Dominicans are handing out plates of rolled crepes to various 
               tables.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               At one table a customer prods a rolled crepe with his fork and 
               a jet of
<b> 
</b>               scalding hot filling squirts out into his face.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CUSTOMER
</b>               (pained scream) Aaghh!! My face!

<b>               
</b>               At another table, another customer digs his fork in, and is rewarded 
               with a
<b> 
</b>               faceful of blistering filling.

<b>               
</b>               Neil sticks his fork into his crepe and recoils as hot liquid 
               jets into his
<b> 
</b>               face.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               (concerned cry) Neil!

<b>               
</b>               The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. 
               Elaine,
<b> 
</b>               Jerry and Kramer look round at the commotion.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why are the crepes spraying?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans 
               are rolling them too
<b> 
</b>               tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Another scream rents the air.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Metropolitan Hospital Center)

<b>               
</b>               In a hospital room, Neil lies in a bed, his face obscured with 
               bandages and
<b> 
</b>               an IV line connected to him. Danielle is there fussing with the 
               remains of a
<b> 
</b>               hospital meal on a tray. George enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating 
               the bed) Is this him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him 
               pretty badly.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George picks up a walking stick which was propped against the 
               bed.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to Danielle) Whose cane is this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               It's Neil's.

<b>               
</b>               Danielle walks away with a water jug from Neil's table. She goes 
               to a sink in
<b> 
</b>               the corner as George speaks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to 
               Neil) So, we meet at last. I
<b> 
</b>               admire your skills, Mr Peanut.

<b>               
</b>               Danielle brings back the jug.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) 
               we should get going. I got a key
<b> 
</b>               made for you.

<b>               
</b>               George flourishes a doorkey before Danielle.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               George, I can't move in with you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (shocked) What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a 
               clinic in England.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (animated) N..no, no. You can't leave 
               me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll
<b> 
</b>               burn myself. I'll burn my parents!

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANIELLE
</b>               Sorry George.

<b>               
</b>               Danielle takes the jug and leaves the room. Dejectedly, George 
               wanders toward
<b> 
</b>               the door. As he moves, Neil whispers to him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEIL
</b>               (beckoning) George.

<b>               
</b>               George leans over to Neil, so he can hear him speak.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEIL
</b>               (quiet triumph) I win.

<b>               
</b>               George purses his lips and nods ruefully. He stands up and leaves, 
               closing
<b> 
</b>               the door behind him. There is a brief pause, then the door opens 
               a few inches
<b> 
</b>               and George's hand reaches back inside the room, takes hold of 
               the IV line and
<b> 
</b>               tugs it sharply, breaking it free of the IV bag,and drops it. 
               Then the hand
<b> 
</b>               is withdrawn and the door closes again.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine sits in an aisle seat in a 747, reading a Let's Go Tunisia 
               book. She
<b> 
</b>               listens as a voice comes over the tannoy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TAN
</b>               Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, 
               we'll be showing our feature
<b> 
</b>               presentation...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (dread) No, no, no, no, no.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TAN
</b>               ...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring 
               Dabney Coleman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is 
               shaping up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Smiling, Elaine puts down her book to watch the movie. Someone 
               from a seat
<b> 
</b>               beside her wants to get out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GUY
</b>               Excuse me, please.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, sure.

<b>               
</b>               The guy pushes past her. He's holding a rolled-up magazine closely 
               to his
<b> 
</b>               body, as if concealing something and, strangely, is wearing a 
<b>               '#1 DAD'
</b><b> 
</b>               t-shirt. There's a little awkwardness as he squeezes by.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (uncomfortable) Ooh.

<b>               
</b>               The guy walks down the aisle and turns to face the passengers. 
               Two other guys
<b> 
</b>               in '#1 DAD' t-shirts flank him. They are the three Dominican 
               guys.

<b>               
</b>               From inside his magazine, Guillermo produces a revolver. The 
               other two guys
<b> 
</b>               also pull out guns, which they point upwards and cock, loudly.
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               There is consternation among the passengers, shocked looks, gasps, 
               etc.
