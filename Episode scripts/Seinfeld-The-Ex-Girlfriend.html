<b>                         THE EX-GIRLFRIEND

</b><b>               
</b>               (Nightclub)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm always in traffic with the lane 
               expert. You know this type of person? 
               Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. 
               Never quite sure, "Is this the best 
               lane for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               me? For my life?" They're always a little bit ahead of you, "Can 
               I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in 
               there?" "Yeah, come on over here, pal.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows 
               about it.." The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological 
               test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. 
               So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than 
               that. I mean, what will happen?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? 
               That someday we'll be going "Boy, this is some really bad traffic 
               now, boy. This, is really bad.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's car)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She can't kill me right?!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, of course not.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               People break up all the time.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Everyday.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It just didn't work out. What can I 
               do? I wanted to love her. I tried to 
               love her. I couldn't.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You tried.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I kept looking at her face. I'd go: 
               "C'mon, love her. Love her!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did you tell her you loved her?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it 
               out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. 
               Alright, at first, I just look at her. 
               I'd go "Oh, really?" or "Boy, that's, 
               that's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               something." But, eventually you have to come back with "Well, 
               I love you." You know, you can only hold out for so long!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're a human being.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And I didn't even ask her out. She asked 
               me out first. She called me up. What 
               was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't 
               do that to someone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're too nice a guy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And 
               she seduced me! We were in my apartment, 
               I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the 
               chair - I get up to go to the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed 
               to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're flesh and blood.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I had nothing to do wtih any of this! 
               I met all her friends, I didn't want 
               to meet them. I kept trying to avoid 
               it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. 
               But
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. 
               "This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. 
               this is my brother.. thisis my father."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's like I'm in quicksand.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I told you when I met her..

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               My back is killing me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's 
               the best.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm gonna make an appointment for you. 
               We'll go together.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Please. They don't do anything.. Look, 
               do I have to break up with her in person? 
               CAn't I do it over the phone? I have 
               no stomach for these things.

</b>               Tell me if you think this is strange: 
               There's this guy who lives in my building, 
               who I was introduced to a couple of 
               years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, 
               or
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each 
               other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop 
               and we would chat a little.. Nothing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. 
               then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just 
               saying hello and continuing on our way.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! 
               He went from nods to nothing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And now, there's this intense animosity 
               whenever we passs. I mean, it's like 
               we really hate each other. It's based 
               on nothing.

</b>               A relationship is an organism. You created 
               this thing and then you starved it so 
               it turned against you. Same thing happened 
               to The Blob.

</b>               You know, you have the slowest elevator 
               in the entire city? That's hard to get 
               used to when you're in so many other 
               fast ones.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, the apartment elevators are always 
               slower than the offices, because you 
               don't have to be home on time.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. 
               And at first, I was just going to walk 
               on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, 
               no. Do not be afraid of this man."
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, I walked up behind him and I tapped 
               him on the shoulder. And I said, "Hi, 
               remember me?" And he furrows his brow 
               as if he's really trying to figure it
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               out. So I said to him, I said, "You little phony. You know exactly 
               who I am."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               "You little phony"?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I did. I most certainly did. And he 
               said, he goes, "Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's 
               friend. We did meet once." And I said, 
               "Well, how do you go from that to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And he says, he says, "Look, I just 
               didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?" 
               And I said, "Fine. Fine I didn't want 
               to say hello anymore either, but I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b>               My act? What does that have to do with 
               anything?

</b>               Well, to be honest, it just didn't make 
               it for me. It's just so much fluff.

</b>               I can't believe this. So what are you 
               saying? You didn't like my act, so that's 
               it?

               what they do.

               humor.

               It was late. They were terrible.

</b>               Women need to like the job of the guy 
               they're with. If they don't like the 
               job, they don't like the guy. Men know 
               this. Which is why we make up the phony
               bogus names for the jobs that we have. "Well, right now, I'm 
               the regional management supervisor." "I'm in development, research, 
               consulting." Men on the other
               hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that 
               concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll 
               just go, "Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that               
               where you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big 
               cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds 
               great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers
               and catch a movie."
