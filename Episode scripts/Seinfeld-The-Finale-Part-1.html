</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It seems like whenever these office 
               people call you in for a meeting, the 
               whole thing is about the sitting down. 
               I would really like to sit down with 
               you. I think we need to sit down and 
               talk. Why don't you come in, and we'll 
               sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting 
               down doesn't work. People get mad at 
               the sitting.You know, we've been sitting 
               here for I don't know how long. How 
               much longer are we just going to sit 
               here? I'll tell you what I think we 
               should do. I think we should all sleep 
               on it. Maybe we're not getting down 
               low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, 
               then our brains will work.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't eat this without catsup. Would 
               it kill her to check up on us? Would 
               that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? 
               Do you need anything? What can I do 
               for you?"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I know what you mean.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not really, but it's something. Ask 
               the people behind you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             WOMAN

</b><b>                             MAN

</b><b>                             WOMAN
</b>               You know what? I don't think so. I'm 
               going to need it from time to time.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               To see a movie.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've been to the movies.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not this movie.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They're all the same. You go, you sit, 
               you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick 
               of it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's usually the kind of mood I'm

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ah! Health's not good enough. I want 
               more than health. Health's not doing 
               it for me anymore. I'm sick
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               We call it a water-cooler show.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because the next day in the offices, 
               people gather around the water coolers 
               to talk about it, right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               See, I think people would talk about 
               it at the coffee machines.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well it's probably just easier to say 
               "water cooler show" than "coffee machine 
               show."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks 
               from a water cooler any more - they 
               use bottles.

               point.

               about a show, "Jerry", that he developed 
               five years ago.

</b>               He said it was a show about nothing. 
               So, I saw the pilot and I've got to 
               tell you - I flipped out.

               13-episode commitment. Start it off 
               on Wednesday night, build up an audience.
               This show needs time to grow. I love that

               by blinking. I would so love to see 
               her - bring a ray of sunshine into her 
               tragic life. But alas, I can't afford 
               it, for I am, as you know, but a simple

               through your little playworld, and wipe 
               that smug smile off your face. And I'll be
               there, in all my glory, watching - watching

</b>               Oh no no no no - we have to be in California 
               next week. We're starting a TV show.

</b>               California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. 
               Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. 
               Better get yourselves a good lawyer.

</b>               Who told you to put the cheese on? Did 
               I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't 
               tell you to put the cheese on.

</b>               Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.

</b><b>                             CHILES
</b>               You people with the cheese. It never 
               ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. 
               Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of 
               it. You don't have to help anybody. 
               That's what this country's all about. 
               That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. 
               Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment 
               with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. 
               I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right 
               away.

</b><b>                             PROSECUTOR
</b>               So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             D.A. HOYT
</b>               Uh huh. You know what that means. This 
               whole place is going to be swarming 
               with media by the time this thing is 
               over. You're not going to be able to 
               find a hotel room in this town. The 
               whole country is going to be watching 
               us. Now we got to do whatever it takes 
               to win it, no matter what the cost. 
               The big issue in this trial is going 
               to be  character. I want you to find out
               everything you can about these people
               - and I mean everything.
