</b><b>                             GEORGE

               No - drops off the meals and that's 
               it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're 
               still entitled to catsup.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I still had it on video. We could have 
               watched it later.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RIVERA
</b>               Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight 
               we'll be talking about what most of 
               you have probably been
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your 
               offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan 
               trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now 
               before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, 
               where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WELLS
</b>               Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RIVERA
</b>               What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WELLS
</b>               Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, 
               considering the media circus that has 
               descended upon this quaint little town.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RIVERA
</b>               And what about the defendants - the 
               so-called New York Four. How are they 
               holding up?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WELLS
</b>               Well, I did speak with one of the deputies 
               who had some contact with them, and 
               he told me quote "There's no love lost 
               with that group."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RIVERA
</b>               Anything else, Jane?

</b><b>                             WELLS
</b>               There also seems to be some friction 
               between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. 
               The rumor is that they once dated,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               and it's possible that ended badly.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RIVERA
</b>               Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, 
               maybe this trial will bring them closer 
               together. Maybe they'll even end up 
               getting married.

               City Council by a vote of twelve to 
               two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, 
               essentially, we made it a crime to ignore 
               a fellow human being in trouble. Now 
               this group from New York not only ignored, 
               but, as we will prove, they actually 
               mocked the victim as he was being robbed 
               at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one 
               other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this 
               is not the first time they have behaved 
               in this manner. On the contrary, they 
               have quite a record of mocking and maligning. 
               This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, 
               immaturity, and greed. And you will 
               see how everyone who has come into contact 
               with these four individuals has been 
               abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. 
               This time, they have gone too far. This 
               time they are going to be held accountable. 
               This time, they are the ones who will

</b>               I am shocked and chagrined, mortified 
               and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! 
               It is a waste of the taxpayers' time 
               and money. It is a travesty of justice 
               that these four people have been incarcerated 
               while the real perpetrator is walking 
               around laughing - lying and laughing, 
               laughing and lying. You know what these 
               four people were? They were innocentbystanders. 
               Now, you just think about that term. 
               Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's 
               exactly what they were. We know theywere 
               bystanders, nobody's disputing that. 
               So how can a bystander be guilty? No 
               such thing. Have you ever heard of a 
               guilty bystander? No, because you cannot 
               be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders 
               are by definition, innocent. That is 
               the nature of bystanding. But no, they 
               want to change nature here. They want 
               to create a whole new animal - the guilty 
               bystander. Don't you let them do it. 
               Only you can stop them.

</b><b>                             BABU
</b>               Then, he got me an apartment in his 
               building. But they mixed up the mail. 
               And I never got my immigration renewal 
               papers. So they deported me. It's all 
               his fault. Him. And the woman. But they 
               did not care. They're totally indifferent. 
               All they do is mock me, just like they 
               did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, 
               mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. 
               All the time! Now it is Babu's turn 
               to mock. Finally I will have some justice. 
               Send them away! Send them all away! 
               Lock them up forever! They are not human. 
               Very bad! Very, very, very bad!

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation 
               for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to
<b> 
</b><b>

               for us. Jane -

               jury asked to see the video tape.

               making sarcastic remarks during the 
               robbery.

</b>               Yes, it's a very incriminating piece 
               of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, 
               this courtroom and everyone who has 
               attended this trial is still reeling 
               from the endless parade of witness who 
               have come forth so enthusiastically 
               to testify against these four seemingly 
               ordinary people. One even had the feeling 
               that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally 
               put a stop to it, it could've gone on 
               for months.

</b>               Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated 
               most strongly with this jury?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WELLS
</b>               That is so hard to say. Certainly there's 
               the doctor with the poison invitations. 
               The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic 
               and tragic figure. And that bizarre 
               contest certainly didn't sit well with 
               this small town jury.There's the woman 
               they sold the defective wheelchair to, 
               the deported Pakistani restaurateur. 
               Geraldo, it just went on,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and on, and on, into the night.

               each other, but your callous indifference 
               and utter disregard for everything that

</b>               course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy 
               sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why 
               do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we 
               have to be sent to prison, in prison?
