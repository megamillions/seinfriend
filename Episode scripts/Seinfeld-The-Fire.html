</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               To me, the thing about birthday parties 
               is that the first birthday party you 
               have and the last birthday party you 
               have are actually quite similar. You 
               know, you just kinda sit there...you're 
               the least excited person at the party. 
               You don't even really realize that there 
               is a party. You don't know what's goin' 
               on. Both birthday parties, people have 
               to kinda help you blow out the candles, 
               you can't do it...you don't even know 
               why you're doing it. What is this ritual? 
               What is going on? It's also the only 
               two birthday parties where other people 
               have to gather your friends together 
               for you. Sometimes they're not even 
               your friends. They make the judgement. 
               They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, 
               and they tell you - 'these are your 
               friends! Tell them thank you for coming 
               to my birthday party.'

</b>               Elaine, Kramer, and Kramer's excitable girlfriend Toby in Elaine's 
               office at Pendant. They're looking at proofs for Kramer's "coffee 
               table book about coffee tables."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOBY
</b>               These are great! Just great! Really 
               great! Really, really great! Don't you 
               think so, Elaine?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, really great.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TOBY
</b>               A coffee table book about coffee tables! 
               (To Kramer) How did you come up with 
               this idea?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It was there!

<b>               
</b><b>                             TOBY
</b>               Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm 
               a coffee table, put some coffee on me! 
               Oh, the hotter the better, that's what 
               I'm here for!' (laughs)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Actually, I've got some work I gotta 
               do, so...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, how about if the book came with 
               these little fold-out legs...so the 
               book itself becomes a coffee table?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOBY
</b>               Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, 
               really great!

</b>               Elaine and Jerry in Jerry's apartment later that day.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               'And that coffee table is saying, put 
               some coffee on me!' I'd like to put 
               some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee 
               - right in her face! I swear! This is 
               like working with a contestant from 
               "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, 
               listen, tell me if you think this is 
               funny - (reads comedy he's written) 
               "Men definitely hit the remote more 
               than women...men don't care what's on 
               TV, men only care what else is on TV. 
               Women want to see what the show is before 
               they change the channel, because men 
               hunt and women nest."

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

               got that impression. What looked like 
               pushing...what looked like knocking 
               down...was a safety precaution! In a 
               fire, you stay close to the ground, 
               am I right? And when I ran out that 
               door, I was not leaving anyone behind! 
               Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my 
               life making sure that exit was clear.

</b>               So you feel "women and children first,"

               so I got out of the seat and I started 
               walking towards him. He says, "Where 
               do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"

               and I kept drivin' the bus with the 
               other, y'know? Then I managed to open 
               up the door, and I kicked him out the

               She said her first order of business 
               is to put my coffee table book into 
               the bookstores as soon as possible.

               he agreed to come down tonight, and 
               he's going to write another article.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I was in a hotel the other day, and 
               on the back of the door in the hotel 
               they have the fire map. I'm flattered 
               that they think I have it together enough 
               to stand in a burning hotel room memorizing 
               directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the 
               stairs, right by the candy machine...' 
               I'd probably get lost, have to go back 
               to the room, check the map again...and 
               they always tell you, no matter what, 
               whatever you do in a hotel fire - do 
               not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to 
               live, I've never panicked in my whole 
               life - it's my option. Even if they 
               find you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, 
               I heard they saved you swingin' from 
               the shower curtain naked with an ice 
               bucket on your head. What happened there?' 
               'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'
