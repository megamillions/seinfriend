<b>                             THE FIX-UP
</b>


                             Written by

                     Larry Charles & Elaine Pope

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. 
               I mean
<b> 
</b>               between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really 
               need
<b> 
</b>               somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does 
               that really help
<b> 
</b>               you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, 
               tap-tap-tap,
<b> 
</b>               start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, 
               okay, once
<b> 
</b>               it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see 
               the cellist
<b> 
</b>               looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't 
               know what to
<b> 
</b>               do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, 
               thank you very
<b> 
</b>               much."

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why even try anymore? There's no sense 
               to it. I'm never gonna meet
<b> 
</b>               anybody, I should just accept it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, yes you will.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I won't.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, maybe you won't.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman 
               you dislike, much less like.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Are my nostrils getting bigger?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No. Why must it be so difficult? Why 
               is there all this tension and
<b> 
</b>               hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street 
               and say, "Hi. I'm
<b> 
</b>               George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

<b>               
</b>               Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers 
               up a meek 'Hi'
<b> 
</b>               which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' 
               a few more times
<b> 
</b>               as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though 
               we was saying that
<b> 
</b>               anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch 
               than read.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another 
               restaurant.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               There's just no men out there, you know?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               I mean the problem is that the good 
               ones know they're good. And they
<b> 
</b>               know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining 
               themselves
<b> 
</b>               to one person.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I hate the good ones.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               Is Jerry one of the good ones?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That's a good question, I think he thinks 
               he is.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               Well, the mediocre ones are available, 
               but they're so insecure about
<b> 
</b>               not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well 
               I'm not good
<b> 
</b>               enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I 
               just go, "You're
<b> 
</b>               right."

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, maybe you need somebody between 
               good and mediocre.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, 
               somebody who just has to
<b> 
</b>               appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I mean it's gotten to the point where 
               I'm flirting with operators on
<b> 
</b>               the phone. I almost made a date with one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, so there's still hope.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. 
               My dream is to become
<b> 
</b>               hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you 
               don't care, that
<b> 
</b>               indifference makes you attractive.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's my only hope.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               See, I wouldn't really mind so much, 
               but I feel badly for my mother.
<b> 
</b>               I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, 
               I'm telling
<b> 
</b>               you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have 
               to kill her
<b> 
</b>               because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her 
               through that.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, at least you're not bitter.

               maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna
<b> 
</b>               be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Went out with Cynthia.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How was it? What'd you talk about?

</b>               Well, you know, the usual; The Federal 
               Reserve, the rainforest.
<b> 
</b>               Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get 
               rid of it in one
<b> 
</b>               fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. 
               What
<b> 
</b>               about you?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We brushed on that. Actually, George 
               was in rare form. He just can't
<b> 
</b>               find anybody.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George too.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY

               You think she's too good for

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well you implied it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I didn't say it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because if you think she's too good

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I went out with you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That's because my standards are too 
               low. And by the way, you know,
<b> 
</b>               women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women 
               pluck their
<b> 
</b>               real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, 
               Jerry. Bald
<b> 
</b>               above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look 
               like that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well let me tell you something about 
               George. He is fast. He can run
<b> 
</b>               like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred 
               pounds over his
<b> 
</b>               head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look 
               at him, but
<b> 
</b>               George can bait a hook.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He can really do that?

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY

               balding.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What kind of hair?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, long dark hair.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Flowing?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Flowing?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading 
               hair. Thick lustrous hair is
<b> 
</b>               very important to me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               'Thick lustrous hair is very important

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Let me ask you this. If you stick your 
               hand in the hair is it easy to
<b> 
</b>               get it out?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Do you want to be able to get it out 
               or do you want to not be able to
<b> 
</b>               get it out?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'd like to be able to get it out.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think you'll get it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What about the skin? I need a good cheek, 
               I like a good cheek.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's got a fine cheek.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is there a pinkish hue?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A pinkish hue?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, a rosy glow.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, 
               women kill to have her
<b> 
</b>               eyebrows.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? 
               I like sweet. But not too
<b> 
</b>               sweet, you could throw up from that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't think you'll throw up. *She* 
               likes to throw up.

</b><b>                             CYNTHIA

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He once spent a weekend with a woman.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We had an incredible phone conversation. 
               We talked for like twenty
<b> 
</b>               minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You 
               know, I thought
<b> 
</b>               she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think it's tamber.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she 
               could do voiceover commercials,
<b> 
</b>               why didn't you tell me about her voice?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I didn't notice the voice.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's mellifluous!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She had to be impressed by that conversation, 
               had to! It was a great
<b> 
</b>               performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they 
               should just have
<b> 
</b>               two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So, what did she say?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She said you're getting together Saturday

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She didn't mention anything about the

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Now, you see, I don't get that. We had

<b> 
</b>               conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention 
               it?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She could have mentioned the conversation.

<b> 
</b>               he gave me a gross.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'll take one. It's possible.

<b>               
</b>               The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we 
               should have like a
<b> 
</b>               secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, 
               you go up
<b> 
</b>               to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) 
               he puts them in
<b> 
</b>               the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little 
               shaving
<b> 
</b>               cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" 
               (nods) "Have a

</b>               perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen 
               is always the
<b> 
</b>               most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

               What kind of a

               I knew we shouldn't have done
<b> 
</b>               this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You told me? You pushed this whole thing

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I was just trying to help your bitter,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, bitter's a judgement call, but

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought you said they had a good time,

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               I'm calling you one if you are one,

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b>               Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap 
               fight, and gets
<b> 
</b>               in the middle.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! 
               Come on, break it up! What's the
<b> 
</b>               matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with 
               each other? I
<b> 
</b>               mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around 
               out there looking
<b> 
</b>               for something that's not even there, when everything that you 
               dream of is right
<b> 
</b>               here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? 
               By the way,
<b> 
</b>               when you see George give him these, these'll work.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I knew those condoms were defective!

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George walks in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Because! Because she missed her period!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               can't believe it! I'm a father!
<b> 
</b>               I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

<b>               
</b>               George rushes out, hysterical.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.

</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               So he shows up. He's all out of breath. 
               He's disheveled. And he
<b> 
</b>               tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine 
               with him and
<b> 
</b>               that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support 
               me in whatever
<b> 
</b>               way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know 
               somebody.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CYNTHIA
</b>               I said to him, "I really appreciate 
               this, but I just got my period."
<b> 
</b>               And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

<b>               
</b>               George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sorry, we're a little late. We got so 
               hung up in traffic.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Very mature.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

</b><b>                             CYNTHIA

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well this is a great place to sit you

</b><b>                             CYNTHIA

               George) right next to the
<b> 
</b>               kitchen.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start 
               eating.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. 
               You get the idea
<b> 
</b>               that the relationship has just ended.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This is good. Oh, this is good.

<b>               
</b>               Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought 
               they would
<b> 
</b>               have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? 
               Now, you're
<b> 
</b>               playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people 
               up. He fixed up
<b> 
</b>               Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. 
               She's very free
<b> 
</b>               about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going 
               out with a snake, I think that's over though."
