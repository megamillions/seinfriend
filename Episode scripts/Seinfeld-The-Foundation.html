<b>                           THE FOUNDATION

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The cemetery. Jerry, George, and the Rosses are standing in front 
               of Susan's tombstone, which reads "Susan Biddle Ross, June 8, 
               1964 - May 19, 1996.")
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well... it's a magnificent stone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MR. ROSS
</b>               They put it up this morning.

<b>               
</b>               (pause.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's just a magnificent stone. (turns 
               to Jerry) Jerry?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry, obviously uncomfortable, turns slowly and shrugs his 
               shoulders at George.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MRS. ROSS
</b>               George... we'll leave you alone with 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MRS. ROSS
</b>               I'm sure there are things you'd like 
               to say.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (She pats his shoulder, and then she and her husband leave Jerry 
               and George alone with Susan.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry turns around to follow the Rosses.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Jerry...

<b>               
</b>               (He tries to keep Jerry there, but Jerry jerks away. George then 
               turns to Susan's stone nervously, trying to think of where to 
               begin. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ross offers Jerry an alcoholic beverage 
               of some sort.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Thank you, no.

<b>               
</b>               (She continues drinking.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to Susan's stone) ...And then, right 
               after the All-Star Break, we, we just 
               swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. 
               (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry's apartment.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Boy, that was awkward!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't mind the cemetery.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What were you saying to the Rosses over 
               there, anyway?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I don't know. I told them her death 
               takes place in the shadow of new life. 
               She's not really dead if we find a way 
               to remember her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What is that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Star Trek II.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (identifying it) Wrath of Khan!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. 
               Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, 
               and they shoot him out the bowel of 
               the ship in that big sunglasses case.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That was a hell of a thing when Spock 
               died...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah...

<b>               
</b>               (For a brief moment, the two become overwhelmed with emotion.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is 
               up, I paid my respects, guess that's 
               it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So it's over?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I have mourned for three long months! 
               Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve 
               in January! It's time for George to 
               start being George again.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All right, so uh, let's do something 
               later. How 'bout a movie?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Kramer enters as George is leaving.)

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Jerry, karate is not here (pointing
