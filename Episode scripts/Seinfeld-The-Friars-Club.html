                             Written by

</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The other thing I love is when you're 
               in the middle of a dream, and the alarm 
               goes off. You incorporate the sound 
               of the alarm into the dream, so you 
               can keep sleeping. And you'll make any 
               adjustment in the dream to do it. I 
               was with Marie Antoinette in a dream 
               last night, and she was on the guillotine, 
               the blade came down, her head fell into 
               the basket, it rolled over and she started 
               singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. 
               And, I thought, "That is not my alarm 
               going off. This is actually happening."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Street, New York)

<b>               
</b>               An elated George leaps around the corner, kicking a cab's door 
               closed and
<b> 
</b>               clapping his hands together.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (joyful) June. It's June.

<b>               
</b>               George begins trotting down the street. He acknowledges a passerby 
               and
<b> 
</b>               high-fives him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (high-fiving) Hey!

<b>               
</b>               George continues his joyful path along the sidewalk, with his 
               hands raised
<b> 
</b>               above his head in celebration.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's June.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George takes the hand of a female passerby and dances a few steps 
               with her,
<b> 
</b>               twirling her round.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               June, June, June.

<b>               
</b>               Releasing the woman, George euphorically prances along, laughing 
               and smiling.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, 
               June.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George leaps onto the footing of a streetlight and spins on it, 
               in
<b> 
</b>               time-honoured musical fashion.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.

<b>               
</b>               George leaps from the streetlight onto the road, where he spreads 
               his arms
<b> 
</b>               and spins.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!

<b>               
</b>               A car brakes behind George and sounds its horn. George flinches, 
               and jigs
<b> 
</b>               nervously out from in front of the automobile and back to the 
               pavement.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               George pushes open the door and enters, still ebullient. He punches 
               the air
<b> 
</b>               as he looks to Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               June. Juune, baby!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               The catering hall screwed up. The wedding 
               is delayed until June. It's
<b> 
</b>               like a stay of execution.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Dead man walking.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) 
               Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky
<b> 
</b>               day.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's 
               not bad.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, 
               good news for you too. Susan's
<b> 
</b>               best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works 
               out, forget about it.
<b> 
</b>               Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's 
               almost as good
<b> 
</b>               as if I didn't get married.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, set it up. You know what, we could 
               have dinner at the Friars Club.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper 
               said he would put me up for
<b> 
</b>               membership.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer opens the door and leans in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, 
               do me a favour, will you? I got
<b> 
</b>               a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up 
               in twenty
<b> 
</b>               minutes, alright?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Catnap?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. 
               I been reading this
<b> 
</b>               book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you 
               know that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (deadpan) That must be some book.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, well, turns out that the master 
               slept only twenty minutes every
<b> 
</b>               three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, 
               that I'm awake
<b> 
</b>               per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I 
               will have lived
<b> 
</b>               the equivalent of a hundred and five years.

<b>

</b>               Bob is working at his desk, with his back to the door. Elaine

</b><b>

</b>               his attention is caught. He stops to listen.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Peterman watches and listens, surprised.

</b>               Elaine looks confused. Peterman begins to leave.

<b>

               it, Elaine. I heard every
<b> 
</b>               word you said.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine realises what Peterman overheard.

</b><b>                             PETERMAN

<b> 
</b>               (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.

</b>               Elaine and Bob sit in the same box used by Jerry, George, Susan 
               and Hallie.
<b> 
</b>               Elaine looks distinctly unenthused at the prospect of spending 
               the evening
<b> 
</b>               with Bob. Bob looks delighted to be ensconced with Elaine.

</b>               These seats are fantastic. It was really

<b>               
</b>               Bob slips one hand round the back of Elaine's seat and leans 
               slightly toward
<b> 
</b>               her.

<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine looks at Bob, wondering what he's talking about. Bob dives 
               across at
<b> 
</b>               Elaine, putting his arms round her and his face on her chest.

               angrily.

</b>               Bob stands for a few seconds, with Elaine glaring at him. Then 
               he dives in
<b> 
</b>               for another go. Elaine struggles with him again.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               Bob slowly gets to his feet. Elaine glares at him, and Bob shamefacedly
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shuffles away out of the box.

</b>               (on phone) You gotta meet me at the 
               police station. They're arresting me 
               for attempted murder.

</b>               On the phone in his office is Jackie Chiles.

</b>               Attempted murder? Of whom?

</b><b>                             CONNIE
</b>               This guy, Kramer.

</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?

</b><b>                             CONNIE
</b>               (surprised) Yeah, that's right.

</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               (adamant) I don't want nothing to do 
               with it.

</b><b>               
</b>               Jackie puts down his phone and looks glad to have escaped.
