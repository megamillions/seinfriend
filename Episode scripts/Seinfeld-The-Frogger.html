</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, there are 200 people who work 
               in this office. Every day is somebody's 
               special day.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine takes a piece of cake and makes her way to the door, but 
               is stopped as a male worker carrying a cake enters.
<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It is the forced socializing. I mean, 
               just because we work in the same office, 
               why do we have to act like we're friends?
<b>

               to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for 
               her.

</b>               Jerry steps out of Lisi's building. He looks both ways cautiously 
               before walking down the steps. Surprised, he sees a shadowy figure 
               walking towards him holding something resembling a head in one 
               hand and a knife in the other.
