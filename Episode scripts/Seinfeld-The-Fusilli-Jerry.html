<b>                         THE FUSILLI JERRY
</b>


                             Written by

                           Marjorie Gross




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment 
               building)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I hear you're going out with David Putty.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. What, is it a problem?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I think he could've asked me. 
               Supposed to be a friend of mine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't 
               care. It *has* been a few years.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend 
               dates. You don't want it to be someone 
               you know, and you don't want it to be 
               someone better than you. Now, even though 
               the latter is *obviously* impossible.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, god.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The former still applies. I don't know 
               what it is, but I just can't see you 
               with a mechanic.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those 
               mechanics do is work all day with their 
               hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms 
               on machines, and then they come home 
               dripping with animal sexuality like 
               Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off 
               that is.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All right.

<b>               
</b>               (At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Look at that. They got lobster on the 
               menu. Who would order a lobster here. 
               I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday 
               hoping *todays* the day.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly 
               you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know, I think we really need to 
               be in front of a television set. You 
               take T.V. out of this relationship, 
               it is *just* torture.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               job.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, you're not a divorcee. You're just 
               separated. You're---you're a separatee.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, he doesn't even do it exactly 
               the same. He--he--he uses a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the 
               pinch. That's not new.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves 
               now. His
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               whole *repertoire* could be lifted.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, it's strange, because he's 
               such an honest mechanic.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Now, the ending is kind of an option. 
               I use the swirl. I like the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is 
               a great
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.

</b>               (stands up) I am.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOCTOR
</b>               Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want 
               you to know that this won't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               take long. And he's going to be fine.

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer stops Dr. Cooperman at the door.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by 
               any chance recently get the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wrong license plates?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DR. COOPERMAN
</b>               Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor 
               vehicle bureau to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               straighten it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So...you're the Assman.

<b>               
</b>               (Dr. Cooperman winks and heads back to where Frank is waiting)

</b><b>

</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million 
               to one.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Back at the Costanza's house, George and Frank are just walking 
               in)

</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               Where have you been?!! You were supposed 
               to fix the stove! I've
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               been waiting for hours!

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               I fell on some Fusilli.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               Fusilli?

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was 
               a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in me. Had to go to the proctologist.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               The proctologist? Are you okay?

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple 
               of tissues from the box)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ma, don't cry!

</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               Oh, I can't help it!
