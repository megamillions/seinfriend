</b>               I never get enough sleep. I stay up 
               late at night, cause I'm Night Guy. 
               Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What 
               about getting up after five hours sleep?', 
               oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's 
               not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay 
               up as late as I want. So you get up 
               in the morning, you're ..... (?), you're 
               exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that 
               Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws 
               Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning 
               Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can 
               do is try and oversleep often enough 
               so that Day Guy looses his job and Night 
               Guy has no money to go out anymore.

               going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow 
               night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. 
               I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta 
               do is bring her with me. And then when 
               Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody 
               time.
