<b>                          THE GOOD SAMARITAN

                             Written by

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at 
               home in her
<b> 
</b>               bed)

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know it's bad enough you have a 
               car phone, you have to use the
<b> 
</b>               speaker?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's safer! Plus it's more annoying 
               to the other person.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Driver cuts in front of Jerry)

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh look at this guy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What's goin' on?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh there's a guy trying to get in front 
               of me, he has to ask
<b> 
</b>               permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Did you get a thank you wave?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, nothing. How could you not give 
               a thank you wave? Hey buddy!
<b> 
</b>               Where's my thank you wave?

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry sticks his head out the window)

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Give me that wave!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jerry, are you free on Friday?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I'm free, why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky 
               today, she asked me to have
<b> 
</b>               dinner with her and her husband.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh my God! You won't believe what I 
               just saw! A car just bashed into
<b> 
</b>               a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You gotta follow that car!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What?!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You can't let him get away with that!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront 
               other
<b> 
</b>               driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving 
               behind you, uh, a few blocks
<b> 
</b>               back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, 
               I witnessed
<b> 
</b>               that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the 
               performance
<b>

<b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               So I wound up going out for a decaf 
               cappuccino with her.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. 
               I have no speech.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, I really liked her. We talked. 
               We flirted. And when she
<b> 
</b>               left, she reached out and touched my arm.

<b>               
</b>               (Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I love when they touch your arm. I can't 
               get enough of that. Why is
<b> 
</b>               that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Let's not even analyze it.

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry begins walking towards door)

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you didn't turn her in?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I wanted to but I couldn't go through

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Friday night.

<b>               
</b>               (Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)

<b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               By the way, Elaine does not need to

<b>

</b>               Because great couples always have a 
               great story about how they met.
<b> 
</b>               That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've 
               never had a
<b> 
</b>               good meeting story.

</b>               said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. 
               And then, and
<b> 
</b>               then he did mention your name.
