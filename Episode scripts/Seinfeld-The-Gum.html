<b>                              THE GUM
</b>


                             Written by

                       Tom Gammill & Max Pross

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (unwrapping a piece of gum) I think 
               gum is, is one of the weirdest human 
               inventions. (pops gum in his mouth) 
               It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's 
               not a food. What is it? It isn't really 
               anything, you know. I mean, it's like 
               a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, 
               remember when you were in school, and 
               teachers would get all riled up if they 
               caught you with gum? And when you were 
               a kid, you'd think 'What is the big 
               deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand 
               it, because when you're chewing gum, 
               you don't look like you're too thrilled 
               with anything anyone has to say. (as 
               sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two. 
               That was an important historical event? 
               Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man 
               on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, 
               right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'

</b>               (Monk's)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry and George sitting in a booth, much as usual)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You think she's happy?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (indicates with his head) The cashier.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ruthie Cohen?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (surprised) You know her name?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sure.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe that's why she's happy.

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer enters. He has a handful of flyers)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good 
               morning, gentlemen.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What is this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That stinky old movie-house?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (sits beside Jerry) Well, you should 
               smell it now. We fixed up the place.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?

</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare 
               archival print. (jumps as his burns 
               his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full 
               wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you 
               come to the one o'clock show, you can 
               hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Geoffrey who?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant 
               wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating 
               insights into the production.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why would I spend seven dollars to see 
               a movie that I could watch on TV?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when 
               you can just stick something in the 
               microwave? Why go to the park and fly 
               a kite, when you can just pop a pill? 
               (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys 
               haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? 
               I'm supposed to meet him here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet 
               him for?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, he's using his connections in 
               the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre 
               landmark status.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought he screwed up the Dinkins 
               campaign.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, he did. You know, after that, 
               he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend 
               a few months in an institution.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. 
               I've taken him under my wing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, then I'm not worried.

<b>               
</b>               Lloyd Braun enters in the background.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               But he still needs all of our support. 
               Now, when he gets here treat him like 
               he's one of the gang, huh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Lloyd wanders toward the guys at the table.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as 
               to conceal his
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               face.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his 
               visitor. He also
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave 
               him earlier.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Kramer and Lloyd sit on the couch. All of them start chewing 
               on the gum.

               he thinks he
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               can get more of this.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               anything he sets his mind to.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you can get it whenever you want.

<b>               
</b>               They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry

<b>               
</b>               George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises.

<b>               
</b>               As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street 
               behind him. The

</b><b>               
</b>               driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.

</b><b>               
</b>               The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had 
               enough. He

</b>               its horn.

<b>               
</b>               The driver rolls down the window, and we see Ruthie Cohen.

</b>               George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at 
               the flames with
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight.

<b>               
</b>               The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body

</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first 
               pair - they're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified 
               hugely. It's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               obvious he can't see at all clearly.

<b>               
</b>               The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. 
               The appearance of

</b>               the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally

</b><b>               
</b>               disgusting.

               and loosening
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk 
               again. As
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog 
               ends with the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le 
               Baron and vomits
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against

</b>               fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding.

</b>               Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in 
               his costume and

</b>               jumps to the obvious conclusion.

</b>               Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they 
               go into a quiet
<b> 
</b><b>
