<b>                          THE HANDICAP SPOT
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (At the comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have a friend who is about to get 
               married, they're having the bachelor 
               party and the
<b> 
</b>               bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while 
               she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at
<b> 
</b>               a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That 
               is possible. But to me, the
<b> 
</b>               difference between being single and being married, is the form 
               of government. You see, when you're
<b> 
</b>               single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete 
               power. I can give the order to fall
<b> 
</b>               asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one 
               can overrule me! When you're
<b> 
</b>               married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything 
               gets done there are meetings.
<b> 
</b>               Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage 
               works. That's what's so painful
<b> 
</b><b>                             ABOUT DIVORCE
</b>               you get impeached and you're not even 
               the president!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, is it my imagination, or do really 
               good looking women walk a lot faster 
               than
<b> 
</b>               everybody else?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We don't walk that fast...

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No seriously...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Seriously, we don't.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               The better looking they are, the faster 
               they go! I mean, I see they out there 
               on the
<b> 
</b>               street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a 
               motor on their ass.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey 
               Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna 
               miss the
<b> 
</b>               previews!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the big hurry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's 
               party on Saturday night?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a 
               present.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I gotta buy a present now?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Of course you do, it's an engagement 
               party.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement 
               present! Then they get married, you 
               gonna
<b> 
</b>               have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another 
               present. Then the baby starts
<b> 
</b>               getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You don't like the Drake?
