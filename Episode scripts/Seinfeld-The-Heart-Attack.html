<b>                          THE HEART ATTACK

</b><b>               
</b>               (Night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that 
               I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of 
               reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number 
               one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, 
               I have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven 
               cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire 
               appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? 
               yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if 
               you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite 
               coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. 
               I've got millions of them, I'll ruin
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               them whenever I want!

</b>               (Scene ends)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)

<b>               
</b><b>                             TV VOICE
</b>               (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the 
               sky. The planets are on fire. It is 
               just as you prophesied. The planets 
               of our solar system, incinerating. Like
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's now asleep)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen 
               and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his 
               head, then goes back to sleep, laughing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to himself)

</b>               (Scene ends)

<b>               
</b>               (Coffee shop)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note 
               paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. 
               I need cucumber.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Trying to read the note) What have 
               I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? 
               I got up last night, I wrote this down, 
               I thought I had this great bit.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. 
               "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't think that's it.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
