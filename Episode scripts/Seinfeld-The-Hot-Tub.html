</b>               I always feel bad for the silver medal 
               winner in the Olympics. How do you live 
               with that the rest of your life? People 
               are gonna keep asking - How much did 
               you lose by? I don't even know...! It 
               was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was 
               like, like... now..now..now...! It was 
               it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, 
               I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, 
               I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never 
               did anything but exercise and work out 
               for 20 years, I flew half way around 
               the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing 
               a tiny distance between his index and 
               thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! 
               Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. 
               If I had a pimple, I would've won.

</b>               (to Elaine) I can't believe you write 
               for this J. Peterman catalog.

</b><b>                             JERRY

               in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank

               busy.

               that you're busy. Think about it... 
               (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
