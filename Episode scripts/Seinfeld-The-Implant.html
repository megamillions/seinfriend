<b>               
</b>               The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people 
               today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking 
               machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way 
               that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just 
               order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, 
               crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'

</b>               Opening scene - Sidra on a Stairmaster at the New York Health 
               Club. Jerry enters after his workout w/gymbag in hand.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               Oh, hi Jerry.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten 
               minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of 
               course there's someone stretching in 
               front of me in a leotard, then I can 
               go an hour.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               Really.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a 
               Stairmaster. You get up there and you 
               stare.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go 
               take a sauna.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>

</b><b>                             SIDRA

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine walks over to Jerry.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Tremendous workout.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That's a pretty girl.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Tremendous girl.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She's the one you went out with last

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. I really like her.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can tell. You know how you're always 
               bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm not bragging, I happen to have a 
               very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks 
               by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' 
               (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to 
               confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

               seem a bit too perfect?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? 
               I don't need legs. I have legs. Have 
               you ever seen her naked in the locker 
               room?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. 
               Maybe if you had seen her naked.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't want to see her naked.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I do.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, that's your problem.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Look, you made the allegation. The least 
               you could do is follow up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna 
               go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative 
               journalism. I need to know!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               But a few more dates and you can find 
               out for yourself!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's 
               on his ninth date with Betsy, he still 
               hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, every time he tries to make a 
               move, something screws up. Like on their 
               last date, they were on the couch, but 
               she was sitting on his wrong side.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, she was on his right side. He 
               can't make a move with his left hand. 
               Can't go left.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What

</b>               New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries 
               to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats 
               him to it.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Can I ask you a question? Would you

</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit 
               here. I don't hear very well out of 
               this ear (points to her right ear) so, 
               I always try to sit to the right of 
               people.

</b>               In the whole world right now, there's 
               maybe three emergencies. Why would you 
               think, on this entire planet, that you're 
               one of those three?

               beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices 
               Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to 
               see her naked to know those aren't real. 
               Why does she need to tie the towel around 
               her? She's got a rack on her chest. 
               (Sidra takes her towel off and lies 
               down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel 
               off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, 
               doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew 
               it, they're definitely fake.

               on the phone.

</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice 
               was so ill, I guess it was really a 
               blessing. (George, on the couch behind 
               Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her 
               to get off the phone so he can continue 
               putting the moves on her. He shrugs, 
               and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly 
               home as soon as I can. (George waves 
               goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through 
               the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. 
               Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, 
               and he manufactures a completely phony 
               look of sorrow.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, she was just showing me pictures 
               of places I can visit when I go to Puerto 
               Rico...you know, when you two went down 
               there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and 
               Elaine out the door, then sits next 
               to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were 
               we?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               I was just leaving.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right, you were leaving.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               I can't believe you sent a woman into 
               the sauna to do that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That was an accident!

<b>               
</b><b>                             SIDRA
</b>               I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, 
               then opens the door again.) And by the 
               way...they're real, and they're spectacular. 
               (Sidra leaves.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to an exterior shot of the funeral home in Detroit. 
               We hear the commotion of George and Timmy fighting.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I 
               never want to see you again!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DR. ALLENWOOD
</b>               Go back to New York! Get out!

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               New scene of a disheveled George at the airport in Detroit, talking 
               to Clerk no. 2.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CLERK 2
</b>               Alright sir, now all I need is a death 
               certificate and you'll be on your way.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, you see, what happened was...the 
               doctor - the very same doctor that was 
               attending to my late aunt - suffered 
               an untimely stroke, and lost the use 
               of his right hand, so...obviously I 
               was unable to get the death certificate. 
               However, I do have this. (Reaches inside 
               his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CLERK 2
</b>               What's this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (We see a photo of George standing next to a coffin.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             CLERK 2
</b>               Nice try.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Not even close, huh?

<b>               
</b><b>
