<b>                             THE JACKET

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying 
               them. I hate picking them out of my 
               closet. I can't stand every day trying 
               to come up with little outfits for myself. 
               I think
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually 
               we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie 
               or a TV show where there's people
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same 
               thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. 
               One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. 
               An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different 
               outfits, no speeches. They walk out,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was 
               nice. I could wear that."

</b>               (Clothing store)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think I've seen enough.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SALESMAN
</b>               Well, I might have something in the 
               back.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               The back? They never find anything in 
               the back. If they had anything good 
               in the back, they'd put it out in the 
               front.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why don't they open up an entire store 
               for the back? Call it, "Just Back." 
               All back. No front. You walk in the 
               front, you're immediately in the back. 
               (Picks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               up a tie display) Look, Elaine, tie car wash.

</b><b>                             CUSTOMER
</b>               (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, 
               I just read that. That's terrific.
<b>

</b><b>                             CUSTOMER
</b>               I always felt he deserved a wider audience.

               leaves) Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? 
               You and George are coming, right? Hotel 
               Westbury, eight o' clock.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. 
               You know, I haven't seen my father in 
               a while and.. you know.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm worried I won't be able to talk 
               to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, 
               I perfer the company of nitwits.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about 
               to leave, he calls me up. He begs me 
               to sit in his car for two minutes, so 
               he can pick up these birds..
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, he said he'd drive me here right 
               after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty 
               minutes! he doesn't come down. I am 
               freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells 
               me
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car 
               away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was 
               going to tow it with me in the car!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, 
               but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to 
               the car.. so, finally, he finally
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he 
               was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different 
               diet. So, we're wandering around trying
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running 
               down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. 
               (Sits down, takes a deep breath) ..So

               fromt he snow last night? (Jerry nods

               the start of the show) Boy, it's too 
               bad you gave me this one too.

</b>               I had a leather jacket that got ruined. 
               Now, why does moisture ruin leather? 
               I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside 
               most of the time? I don't understand 
               it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, "Let us in, 
               we're all wearing leather.. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the 
               whole outfit here.." "Is it suede?" "I am
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this cleaned. It's 
               all I got!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                            THE END
