</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY, ON THE PHONE
</b>               Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
               Chinese food!

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Who was it?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I did a show for a car dealership and 
               they're getting me a new SAAB.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What about your old car? They couldn't 
               get Kramer's blood out of it?
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, the engine clotted. You know who 
               set this whole thing up for me?
<b> 
</b>               Frank Merman.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked 
               that guy.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why? He's harmless.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Every summer you guys went to camp together. 
               I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               He was not the summer you. Besides, 
               you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I made him up.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Too bad. It was erotic.
               jackbooted thugs!

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               'Pottery Barn'?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs 
               in one day. That makes eight 
               this month.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why don't you just throw 'em out?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, no. I've been saving them up here 
               in your apartment. And now, 
               it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn'
               is in for a world of hurt.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               phones. So you wanna grab a bite?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't. I gotta make the weekly call 
               to the folks.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So call now.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, 
               a few
<b> 
</b>               you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile 
               Frankie the one
<b> 
</b>               that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's him.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is he still nuts?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               What do you think? They gave me a new 
               car for thirty minutes of 'So, 
               who's from out of town?'
               or what?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Mmm. De-lish.

<b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Delish?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Delish. You know, short for delicious.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Oh, like scrump.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                             PUDDY
</b>               I'm gonna be late. See ya later.

<b>                             JACK
</b>               Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, it's Georgie.

<b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               Let me put your father on the phone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ma!

<b>                             FRANK
</b>               Who is this?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at 
               Fortunoff's the other day, and,
<b> 
</b>               you know what, you were right.

<b>                             FRANK, HANGING UP
</b>               Sorry, George, our Chinese food just 
               came. Talk to you
<b> 
</b>               later.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Chinese food?

<b>               
</b>               sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, maybe they had Chinese food?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               After dark? Please. At their age, that's 
               like swallowing stun
<b> 
</b>               grenades.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, there's one way to check. Where 
               there's Chinese food, there's
<b> 
</b>               leftovers.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for 
               the Chinese food leftovers.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b>               fairy tale moment.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?

<b>                             ELAINE

               to him?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.

<b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b>               guy can... handle the workload.

               'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all 
               these
<b> 
</b>               companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.

</b>               It is the van! Don't you remember, we 
               always talked about how cool
<b> 
</b>               it would be to have a van and just drive?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               We were ten.

</b>               You don't understand. This is Fragile 
               Frankie Merman. When we were in
<b> 
</b>               camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, 
               and sit in it.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, 
               and get a bumper sticker that
<b> 
</b>               says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'

               What if I decided that

<b> 
</b>               I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides

               maybe even

</b><b>                             POSTMASTER GENERAL
</b>               Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, 
               after all, I drove
<b> 
</b>               all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh?

<b>                             POSTMASTER GENERAL
</b>               I even had to cancel a round of golf 
               with the secretary
<b> 
</b>               of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                             POSTMASTER GENERAL
</b>               Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some 
               of your material
<b> 
</b>               imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah! Ha ha.

<b>                             POSTMASTER GENERAL
</b>               Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn 
               serious about it.
<b> 
</b>               In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both 
               know, it's the
<b> 
</b>               job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can 
               understand why
<b> 
</b>               I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I'm very, very sorry.

<b>                             POSTMASTER GENERAL
</b>               Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a 
               stack of mail out
<b> 
</b>               at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't 
               you Mr.
<b> 
</b>               Kramer?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Sure do!

               Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his
