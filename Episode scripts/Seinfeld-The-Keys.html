<b>                              THE KEYS
</b>

</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day 
               and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need 
               keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the 
               ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, 
               maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics 
               looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did 
               it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they 
               don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, 
               we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, 
               I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys 
               to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running 
               underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're 
               actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe 
               he left it up there somewhere..."

</b><b>                             OPENING SCENE
</b>               Jerry's apartment in the middle of the 
               night. Jerry comes out of his room. 
               We hear his thoughts.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY'S BRAIN
</b>               What is it about sleep that makes you 
               so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? 
               It's not like I'm running a marathon, 
               I'm just lying there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry notices his door is open.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY'S BRAIN
</b>               What the hell...? Why is the door open?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, 
               and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns 
               on the light.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer, what are you doing here!?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm 
               sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! 
               Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds 
               Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted 
               to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used 
               the spare keys that you gave me to come 
               into your apartment to get your popper.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You scared me!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's just me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's enough!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, 
               grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles 
               it around, then exits.)
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>

</b>               New scene. Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly 
               trying to get in the door.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads 
               for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble 
               bath in his tub.)
<b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               Because you see, George, having the 
               keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept 
               me in a fantasy world. Every time I 
               went over to his house, it was like 
               I was on vacation. Better food, better 
               view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much 
               cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored 
               the squalor in my own life because I'm 
               looking at life, you see, through Jerry's 
               eyes. I was living in twilight, George. 
               Living in the shadows. Living in the 
               darkness...like you.

</b>               About five years ago. I was going down 
               this very road. Same time of day, going 
               about the same speed I'm going now...there 
               was a rock in the road. Couldn't have 
               been more than a pebble. Never really 
               saw it! Lost control of the bike, went 
               flyin' about a hundred feet - came down 
               right on my head. Cracked it wide open! 
               Blood and stuff was just splattered 
               all over the road, there...I broke every 
               bone in my face. Hey, you know, when 
               they found me, my eyes were hanging 
               out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced 
               me dead at the scene. I was in a coma 
               for...well, they told me about a year...said 
               I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but 
               I showed 'em. Ever since then I always 
               wear a helmet! (The biker goes into 
               a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)

               keys, it doesn't entitle you to break 
               into their apartment. That's the reason 
               you took away Kramer's keys.

               to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed 
               to give 'em back to her, so she can 
               give 'em back to me, because she has 
               mine. So technically, those are my keys.

               keys back from Kramer, he never would 
               have taken his back from you and given 
               'em to me, in which case I wouldn't 
               have had to take mine back from her.

</b>               Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine 
               enters the room behind Jerry and George. 
               Jerry spots her and tosses his half 
               of the script at George. George throws 
               it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know. Those writers make a lot

</b>               Elaine, let me tell you something about 
               show business. It's hard work! You don't 
               just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta 
               watch the show, study it, get a sense 
               of the characters, how they relate to 
               each other.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters 
               under her breath) God, what an asshole.
