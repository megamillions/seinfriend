<b>                           THE KISS HELLO
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now, I was thinking the other day about 
               hair, and that the weird thing about 
               it, is that people will touch other 
               people's hair. You will actually kiss 
               another human being, right on the head. 
               But, if one of those hairs should somehow 
               be able to get out of that skull, and 
               go off on its own, it is now the vilest, 
               most disgusting thing that you can encounter. 
               The same hair. People freak out. (horrified) 
               "There was a hair, in the egg salad!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               George sits on the couch with a newspaper, Jerry stands.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They 
               go out dancing. You
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               think they do the flamenco?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I would think.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you could call a woman for a date, 
               ask her if she's free for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Dinner and a flamenco?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first 
               date.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular 
               here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah? Would you do it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, I think I would.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I knew you'd have an affinity 
               for it, because it's the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               dance of a very proud people.

<b>               
</b>               The phone rings. Jerry answers.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) 
               What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry 
               about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you 
               later. Alright, bye.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               He hangs up the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have to go over to my grandmother's.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What for?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have to open a bottle of ketchup for 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So, what, no lunch?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, we have time.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh. How's she doing?

<b>               
</b>               George rises, and he and Jerry collect their jackets and make 
               their way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, she's starting to slip a little. 
               Sometimes she has
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier 
               way to open ketchups. They should make 
               it in a tube.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Like toothpaste?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ya-hah.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and George leave.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Street)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and George stroll along, continuing their conversation.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There's a squeeze ketchup.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never 
               seen squeeze ketchup.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, if they make squeeze mustard, 
               doesn't it stand to reason
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that they make squeeze ketchup?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself 
               to the squeeze.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I really don't see the difference.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's subtle.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet 
               us?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. 
               Uh-oh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b>               They stop walking.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta 
               kiss her hello. I just did
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread 
               seeing her because
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of it.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry smiles and waves to Elaine, who is approaching with Wendy. 
               Elaine
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I told you I admire your hearing.
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with a kiss on the cheek, which he's not happy about. Wendy is 
               attractive, but has
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               a real old-fashioned fifties-style hairdo.

</b><b>               
</b>               sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Wendy takes a brief glance at George's proffered limb. Elaine

</b>               happy that George is bothering Wendy.

</b>               Wendy fishes in her bag and hands a card to George.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She's a physical therapist. She doesn't

</b><b>               
</b>               with that outside of the office.

</b>               Why not?

<b>               
</b>               The trio sit down in a booth.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Because, it is what she does.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I love these people, you can't ask 'em 
               questions. (getting
<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>               
</b>               last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, you know, frankly, outside of 
               a sexual relationship, I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking 
               either, but
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               one step at a time.

<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               She looks like something out of an old

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Should say something to her.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, I could never say anything to her 
               about that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

               say something like
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.

               never do it.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What you have to do is introduce him,

</b><b>               
</b>               out with it.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>

</b>               It's the obligation, you know? As soon 
               as this person comes in,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch 
               a breast as part
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a 
               little better.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry holds up his hands, indicating he wants a few seconds to

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               He goes to the refrigerator, and indicates Elaine should let 
               Wendy inside.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine opens the door and Wendy enters.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry has the door of the fridge open, and his head is inside 
               the

</b><b>                             WENDY
</b>               Oh, hi Jerry.

<b>               
</b>               Wendy wanders over to the fridge.

</b>               Jerry holds out his arm, with a bottle in his hand.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry starts to withdraw his head from the fridge, and Wendy 
               is poised
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for the kiss hello. But, just as he turns to face her, he opens 
               the freezer
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               Jerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast 
               is clear.

</b>               Finding

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer does looks at Wendy, and something intrigues him. He turns 
               away,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Then back again, unable to take his eyes off her hair.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (points) You know, I really like that

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine both look surprised and let-down by Kramer.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Kramer raises his camera to take a picture of Wendy and her hair.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer presses the button and nothing happens. He turns the camera

</b>               Lower arm, clearly much more comfortable.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer has covered one wall of the lobby with photographs of 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               tenants. They're all labeled with the appropriate name in magic 
               marker. Kramer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               is just completing Jerry's name underneath the Polaroid he took 
               earlier. Jerry
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and Elaine enter from the street.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine seems generally positive, Jerry's not so enamoured, especially

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               by his own picture.

</b>               Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's 
               terrible...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The Polaroid has caught Jerry with his mouth hanging open and 
               his eyes
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wide. It's not flattering in the slightest.

</b>               then

</b>               Mary leans across and gives Jerry a quick kiss on the cheek,

</b>               Wendy driving into New York at night with Elaine as passenger. 
               Elaine
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               is wearing much of her ski gear - woolly hat, with goggles on 
               top of her head, and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               there are ski poles on the back seat.

</b><b>                             WENDY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b>               Wendy and Elaine share a laugh. Wendy then starts to pull the 
               car over
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the side of the road.

</b>               Elaine struggles along the sidewalk at night with her ski gear 
               in her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               arms. She's not finding it easy fighting with the uncomfortable 
               bulk of skis,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               poles, boots, etc.. Eventually she drops the boots and, rather 
               than pick them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               up, simply kicks them along in front of her.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. 
               Isn't that strange?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.

</b>               if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               With someone with a hairdo like that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I had to carry my skis, and my boots 
               and my poles. I think I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pinched a nerve in my shoulder.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You should have her work on it for you.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry enters his building. Mary spots him from across the lobby 
               and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               closes for a kiss hello.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry backs away from the kiss with so much effort that he's 
               up against

<b>               
</b>               The door to the street opens and Louise enters, also friendly 
               and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               aiming for the kiss hello.

               here?

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No no no. She changed her hairstyle, 
               (pulls a face) it's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               terrible. No,

<b>               
</b>               we're done.

<b>               
</b>               A happy looking guy pushes his way past Kramer and out of the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               apartment.

</b><b>                             GUY
</b>               I'll go get some more beer.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after 
               the guy) And get some of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               those blue corn chips.

<b>               
</b>               An attractive redheaded woman comes along the hallway. Kramer 
               greets
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Her approach.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey.

</b><b>                             STEFANIE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ooh, I like that.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Stefanie. 2-G.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few 
               people here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry tries to see around Kramer into his apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite 
               you in, but uhm... you know.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer closes the door, and Jerry can be seen peering through 
               the narrowing gap until it shuts.
