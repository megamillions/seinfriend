               girlfriend.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NINA

               I can't do this if you keep
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               moving.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You sure you don't want me to take my 
               clothes off? (beat) I'll do it!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NINA
</b>               No, that's the last thing in the world 
               I want you to do.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, why don't you take your clothes 
               off?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NINA
</b>               I don't know... I don't think Jerry 
               would like that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little 
               secret.

</b>               (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling 
               with his fly) Button fly!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get 
               these
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               things open!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I like the button fly.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (incredulous) What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That is one place on my wardrobe I do 
               not need sharp interlocking
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are 
               you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               doing today?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nothing.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have to go meet Nina. Want to come 
               up to her lot, check out her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               paintings?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't get art.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There's nothing to get.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it always has to be explained 
               to me, and then I have to have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               someone explain the explanation.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She does a lot of abstract stuff. In 
               fact she's painting Kramer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right now.

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a 
               wall.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
