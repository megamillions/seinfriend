</b>               Let me speak with the head librarian. 
               ... Because it's absurd. An overdue 
               book
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio 
               station?
<b>

</b>               Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK 
               I can be down there in like a half hour.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What's the problem?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               This you're not goin' to believe. The 
               NYPL says that I took out Tropic of 
               Cancer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in 1971 and never returned it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Do you know how much that comes to? 
               That's a nickel a day for 20 years. 
               It's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               going to be $50,000

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It doesn't work like that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's not going to be anything. I returned 
               the book. I remember it very vividly
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. 
               It was the first time I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade 
               she was developing this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. 
               And then one day ...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That orange dress is burned in my memory
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I wonder what ever happened to her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, computers, they're cracking down 
               now on overdue books. The whole thing 
               is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               completely ridiculous.

</b>               What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where 
               you go in you can take
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring 
               it back when you're done.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had 
               when they were a little
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just 
               be his friend. That's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And 
               that's why everybody
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... 
               I'll bring it back late.
