<b>                              THE LIMO
</b>


                             Written by

                           Larry Charles




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores 
               have any idea
<b> 
</b>               what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you 
               think they just
<b> 
</b>               feel they have their own little country out there and they can 
               charge anything
<b> 
</b>               they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You 
               don't like it;
<b> 
</b>               go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline 
               complex is a
<b> 
</b>               huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit 
               is what's
<b> 
</b>               supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about 
               it; the terminals,
<b> 
</b>               the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't 
               notice the beating
<b> 
</b>               that you're taking on the tuna.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George is at the airport.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's all departures. I see nothing but 
               departures. (to the woman
<b> 
</b>               beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?

<b>               
</b>               The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the 
               other side.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               There's a clock over there.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Where?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               There.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               But you have a watch on.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               It's right by the escalator.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why don't you just look at your watch?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               I told you, it's right over there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Let me see the watch.

<b>               
</b>               George grabs the man's wrist.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know we're living in a society!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry walks up from the ramp.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Jerry. Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've 
               you been waiting?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I just got here. My car broke down on 
               the Belt Parkway.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry, Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece 
               of junk.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               One mile from the exit it starts shaking, 
               really violently shaking,
<b> 
</b>               like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you have no car?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what good are you?

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says 
<b>               O'BRIEN
</b><b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's 
               gonna be waiting a while,
<b> 
</b>               O'Brien's not showing up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               How do you know?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, 
               wouldn't let him on the
<b> 
</b>               plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square 
               Garden.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We should take his limo.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wait a second. Think about it. He's 
               not showing up. Wait till you
<b> 
</b>               see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said 
               he's in
<b> 
</b>               Chicago.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He's definitely in Chicago.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well the guy's just standing there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How would we do it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We just go up to him, we say, "We're 
               O'Brien."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe he knows O'Brien?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew 
               O'Brien he wouldn't have a
<b> 
</b>               sign. Let's just do it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What if we get caught?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What's gonna happen? They can't kill

</b>               I'm not telling you.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a

<b>

               it left me

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the Knicks-Bulls game.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Limo? I thought that George went to

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well then why would they take a limo

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's pretty strange. Did he say anything

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really 
               important that we call them
<b> 
</b>               O'Brien and Murphy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               O'Brien. Why would he want to be called

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b>               minority communities.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're not going to open with that,

</b><b>                             EVA
</b>               What was that you said about the myth

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I said so many things.

<b>               
</b>               Suddenly they hear a loud bang.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b>               The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look 
               around, Eva has
<b> 
</b>               fallen on top of George.

<b>               
</b>               Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's really very nice of you, Eva.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             EVA
</b>               But of course you know I would. I would 
               do anything for you. Anything.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Tim returns.

<b>               
</b><b>                             TIM
</b>               Nothing to worry about, it was just 
               a flat tire. But rest assured, we're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               prepared to handle anything that might come up.

<b>               
</b>               Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and 
               starts handling
<b> 
</b>               it sensually.

</b><b>                             JODI
</b>               I'm standing in front of the Paramount 
               adjacent to Madison Square Garden
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators 
               are gathering to
<b> 
</b>               protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the 
               leader of the
<b> 
</b>               midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to 
               be their most
<b> 
</b>               charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate 
               of the violent
<b> 
</b>               overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration 
               of Adolf
<b> 
</b>               Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. 
               There is a
<b> 
</b>               full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources 
               tell me he is
<b> 
</b>               in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set 
               up barricades, but
<b> 
</b>               quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match 
               for the emotional
<b> 
</b>               fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount,

</b>               They begin running full speed towards the gang.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b>               George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which 
               speeds off.
<b>

               Murphy?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TIM

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It could be very confusing.

<b>               
</b>               The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah? Eva?

<b>               
</b><b>                             EVA

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               O'Brien? Well that's weird.

</b><b>                             EVA
</b>               Who are you?

<b>               
</b>               George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's 
               car broke
<b> 
</b>               down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JODI
</b>               A limousine has just pulled up it's 
               being surrounded by a huge group of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, 
               none of the three
<b> 
</b>               are intelligible at this point.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JODI
</b>               They are banging on the car, trying 
               to flip it over. The police seem
<b> 
</b>               unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. 
               O'Brien must be
<b> 
</b>               having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for 
               his first public
<b> 
</b>               appearance.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated 
               and less
<b> 
</b>               understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva 
               are becoming
<b> 
</b>               unnerved.

<b>               
</b><b>                             EVA

</b><b>

               says 'DONALD

<b>               
</b>               So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World 
               War Two movie and
<b> 
</b>               there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in 
               those movies always
<b> 
</b>               had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that 
               they would do
<b> 
</b>               and then when they were around the offices they had like this 
               casual heil,
<b> 
</b>               remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, 
               heil, how are ya,
<b> 
</b>               is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished 
               with the copier?
<b> 
</b>               Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, 
               heil, nice
<b> 
</b>               to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?
