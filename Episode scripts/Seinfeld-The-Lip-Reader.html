</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Professional tennis. To me I don't understand 
               all the shushing. Why are they always 
               shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players 
               know that we're there? Should we duck 
               down behind the seats so they don't 
               see us watching them? Tennis is basically 
               just ping-pong and the players are standing 
               on the table. That's all it is. And 
               that goofy scoring, you win one point 
               and all the sudden you're up by 15. 
               Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds 
               like an English call girl. "That'll 
               be 30, love... And could you be a little 
               quieter next time, please, shh."

               the ball back and forth.

</b>               I need higher. This has paba in it, 
               I need paba-free.
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Yes, I have a problem with paba.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You don't even know what paba is.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know enough to stay away from it.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're bringing a date to a party?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A party is a bad date situation. It 
               doesn't matter who you're with. You 
               could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't 
               want to sit and talk with Hoover all 
               night. You want to circulate. (Makes 
               hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting 
               to talk to?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I would think, with the law enforcement 
               and the cross dressing. Seems like an 
               interesting guy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta 
               take her with me. Todd introduced us, 
               I'm obligated.

               real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry?

</b>               Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime 
               I take one, the driver will *not* stop 
               talking to me. No matter how disinterested 
               I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, 
               blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
               always have to have a social componant? 
               Now a stage coach, that would have been 
               a good situation for me. Cause I'm in 
               the coach, and the driver is way up 
               there on the stage.

               snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. 
               He had it all over his face. He was 
               wearing that chocolate on his face like 
               a beard and they got in there real nice 
               and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping 
               up ice cream.)

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't understand things were going

</b>               You're giving me the "it's not you,

               you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's

<b>

               lend her to everybody.

</b>               Kramer and Laura are arguing back and forth with sign language.

</b>               Kramer is sitting poised on the sideline. He waves back to the

               springs into action running toward the ball and runs into Monica
