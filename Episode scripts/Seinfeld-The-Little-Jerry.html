<b>                          THE LITTLE JERRY
</b>


                             Written by

                        Jennifer Crittenden



<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry and Elaine are waiting on the street for George.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what happened to you yesterday? We 
               were supposed to go to the auto show, 
               I waited for you, you never came.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long 
               did you wait?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Five minutes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Five minutes? That's it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the difference? You never showed 
               up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I could've! I mean, last week we waited 
               for that friend of Kramer's for like, 
               forty minutes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, we barely knew the guy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, the longer you know someone, the 
               shorter you wait for 'em.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's the way it works.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               When did you tell George to be here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. 
               How long has it been?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               About five.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's enough. (They leave. George comes 
               around the corner.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.

<b>               
</b>               Commercial break.

<b>               
</b>               New scene - Jerry and Kramer in a booth at the coffee shop.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So, I noticed you bounced a check at 
               the bodega.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How did you know about that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Because Marcelino, he taped it up on 
               his cash register with all the other 
               bad checks.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He can't do that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes 
               his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. 
               This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George enters and sits down.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Fantastic day! Fantastic!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and 
               this piece of apple-skin, that must 
               have been lodged in there for days, 
               comes loose.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Fantastic.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Then, I'm at The Foundation...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're still doing that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sometimes, once in a while.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               When you feel guilty.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, occasionally I'll forget to let 
               the machine pick up. Anyway, they made 
               this large donation to a women's prison, 
               and I get to go down there and check 
               it out.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's caged heat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah-hah!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What are you gonna do there?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nothing really, you know...just stroll 
               around the cell blocks, maybe take in 
               a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey, you 
               know you got a bounced check hanging 
               up in the little market over on Columbus?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, I know, I know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I noticed you chose the "clowns with 
               balloons" check design.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It was a mistake, the bank sent me the 
               wrong ones.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Elaine enters with her new boyfriend, Kurt.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this 
               is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KURT
</b>               Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. (Kramer 
               gets up to leave by climbing over the 
               back of the booth. He loses it and falls 
               on the floor, then regains his composure 
               and walks out with his napkin still 
               tucked in his collar.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KURT
</b>               I gotta call the office. Honey, would

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry 
               and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry 
               is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer 
               starts filling a pot with water.) What 
               are you doing with that?
