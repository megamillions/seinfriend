</b>               I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't 
               jealous of you. It was just the whole 
               marriage thing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ya know, I was just a little surprised.

</b>               Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I 
               mean can anybody answer that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What about all the loser stuff?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know where the rabbi got that. 
               Ya know I never said that. I said "I've 
               never seen you looser".
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can see the can if you're in the army, 
               but fresh fruit it's available, it's 
               there, it's 2 aisles over.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What kind of shopping?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Clothes shopping.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, it's her uncle's.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So ya know, my friend and I we were 
               going to the movies and we stopped off
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               and bought this cafe latte.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               (Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like 
               Italian coffee?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah that's right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Half milk, half coffee?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Hm Hm. You take a sip?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yes I did.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Now when you took a sip, did you notice 
               it was hot? Were you able to sip
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it in your normal fashion?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal 
               fashion.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take 
               big sips?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well I think I take a normal sip.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong 
               with that. Then what happened?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well you know ahh, they don't allow 
               outside drinks in the movie theater.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Yeah, see they like to sell their own 
               coffee.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's 
               gonna be a problem for them.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an 
               infringement on your
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's definitely preposterous.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               So. Then what happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well ahh. I was trying to get to my 
               seat and I had to step over someone 
               and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Was there a top on it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               Now did you put the top on or did they 
               put the top on for you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No. They put the top on.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JACKIE
</b>               And they made the top. You didn't make 
               the top did you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Kramer motions that he did not make the top)

</b>               that they make the security guard just stand there all day?

</b>               See, didn't bother Susan either. That's 
               why I'm different. I can sense
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the slightest human suffering.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Let me just say this. It is inhumane

</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe they offered him a chair and he 
               turned it down.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Would you get out of here. Who's gonna 
               turn down a chair? I would be
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe 
               I'll have a talk

</b><b>                             MAESTRO
</b>               Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called 
               Maestro and I don't.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I mean don't you think that he 
               was probably called Maestro while he
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends 
               probably just called
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               him Lenny.

</b><b>                             MAESTRO
</b>               I happen to know for a fact, that he 
               was called Maestro in social
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him 
               and said
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               "Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It it's huge. It's probably like North

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Well it's tough to get a good read but

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               he'd sit.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So are you gonna get him a chair?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yup. It's really just a question of 
               what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, that would give him some height, 
               be able to check things out. With a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               back or without.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh I think I'd go for the back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Swivel?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe 
               one of those director's chairs. What
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               do you think of those.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. 
               You know my parents used to have a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
