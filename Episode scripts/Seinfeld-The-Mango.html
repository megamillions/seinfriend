</b>               A female orgasm is kinda like the bat 
               cave. A very few people know where it 
               is and if you're lucky enough to see 
               it you probably don't know how you got 
               there and you can't find you way back 
               after you left.

</b>               Nobody does. You know, nobody knows 
               what to do. You just close your eyes 
               and you hope for the best. I really 
               think they're happy if you just make 
               an effort.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               everything's all right and all of a 
               sudden you get that tap. (George taps 
               his own shoulder). You know it's like 
               pfffff (whistling sound), all right 
               that's enough, you're through.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's like the manager coming out and 
               asking you for the ball.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well maybe she just wanted to move on 
               to other business.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got 
               the hook. I wish I could get a lesson 
               in that.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's a very complicated area.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You can go crazy trying to figure that

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               It's all your fault! You and Elaine! 
               All that orgasm talk. She did have an 
               orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm 
               this, orgasm that. I got so focused 
               on it. I started to panic and boom, 
               I lost it. I tried everything, I was 
               talking to him: 'Please wake up, do 
               something.'

</b>               You know it happens to everybody. It 
               happened to Houdini. And he could get 
               out of a trunk under water with his 
               hands in chains! But he had a problem 
               with that. The miracle is that it ever 
               happens.

</b>               It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I 
               think it would be easier to bend a spoon 
               mentally than to make that transformation.
