<b>

</b><b>

</b>               Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years 
               I've had this T-shirts, it's my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               best one, I call him...Golden Boy

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'm on the phone here.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Golden Boy is always the first shirt 
               I wear out of the laundry, here
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               touch Golden Boy!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No thanks. (to the phone)Yeah, Yeah 
               I'll hold.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But see look at the collar, see it's 
               fraying. Golden Boy is slowly
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               the T-shirts such a tragic figure.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak 
               in the sink with some
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Woolight?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No!!! The reason he's iron man is because 
               he goes out there and plays
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               from him, you break his spirit!
