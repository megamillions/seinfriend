</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not since June 29, 1980.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You remember the date?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, because my previous vomit was also 
               June 29th... 1972. That's why during 
               the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: 
               "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on 
               June 29th again."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't 
               thrown up in eight years, I was wondering 
               if he was normal.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just 
               happens to have the same name as one 
               of the worst serial killers in the history 
               of New-York.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's 
               office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta 
               go. (she hangs up)
<b>

</b><b>                             JOANNE
</b>               Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a 
               bus stop.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JOANNE

               good looking, he's a good shaver and

</b>               Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Eighteen strangles.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? 
               Because he was adopted. (saying it as 
               he's taking a lot of paper towels from 
               Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused 
               at Kramer's statement) Just like Son 
               of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption 
               leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves 
               and we don't know why he needed so much 
               paper towels)

</b>               (Jerry doesn't have the time to open his mouth before Kramer

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               Mango where Karen tells George that 
               she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed 
               to when she has sex with him)

</b>               George likes them, he feels it's a good 
               personality showcase. He likes a date 
               to see him with a friend so she can 
               get a window into his nondate personality.

               coffee and after every sip he would 
               go: "Ahh!". I mean every two seconds: 
               "Ahh!". And he would take like 40 sips 
               and after everyone: "Ahh!". I had to 
               drop the class.

</b>               Look it's no secret what's going on 
               between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like 
               me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George, anything you have to say to 
               her, you can say in front of me.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and 
               turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman 
               hates me so much. I'm starting to like 
               her.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She just dislikes me so much... It's 
               irresistable.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can see that.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got to go after her.
