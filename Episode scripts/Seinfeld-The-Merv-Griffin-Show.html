</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why were you making gravel?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well ... I like the sound it makes when

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Hey, those look familiar.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Of course. It's garbage.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, no, no. These brown things. 
               The chairs. Jerry, this is the set from 
               the old Merv Griffin
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Show! They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind 
               the Smithsonian.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot 
               Gold is sitting on you and the next 
               thing -
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you're yesterday's trash.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not 
               finished taking this in.
<b> 
</b><b>
