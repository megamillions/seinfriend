</b><b>

</b>               (Putumayo)

<b>               
</b>               Inside a store full of ethnic merchandise. Elaine is examining 
               some sort of
<b> 
</b>               footwear, while behind the counter Gladys is on the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Uh, excuse me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GLADYS
</b>               Be with you in a minute. (turns her 
               back to Elaine and continues into
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               phone) No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Uhm, I just have a question.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GLADYS
</b>               (into phone) I know, the margaritas 
               in that place are so strong.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like 
               to buy these hirachis.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GLADYS
</b>               (into phone) So? What else is goin' 
               on?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (shouts) HEY!!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GLADYS
</b>               Listen, I'll call you back. (to Elaine) 
               Yes? What can I do for you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (tosses the hirachis onto the counter) 
               Nothing. You, just lost a
<b> 
</b>               customer.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine stalks to the door, but ruins her exit by trying to push 
               open a door she
<b> 
</b>               should pull.

<b>               
</b>               (Valerie's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry, pulling on his jacket, and Valerie preparing to leave.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             VALERIE
</b>               Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the 
               previews.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Me neither. I love the previews. In 
               fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             VALERIE
</b>               I think that I was in that theatre. 
               That, that was really funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just 
               check my messages before we go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Valerie heads toward the door. Jerry sits by the phone, lifts 
               the receiver and
<b> 
</b>               prepares to dial. As he does so, he notices button '07' on the 
               speed-dial is
<b> 
</b>               marked 'JERRY'. He looks surprised and pleased together.

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and George stood talking.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you're on the speed dial?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               After two dates!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What number?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Seven.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wha! You know, it's a pain to change 
               that. You gotta lift up that
<b> 
</b>               plastic thing with a pen.

<b>               
</b>               The door opens and Kramer enters. He's carrying a couple of folding 
               chairs in
<b> 
</b>               each hand.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh, hey buddy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer carries the chairs across the room.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It all right if I keep these here for 
               a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               party.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're gonna keep these here for eight 
               months?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer props the chairs up against a wall.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. 
               The millennium. I told
<b> 
</b>               you about that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs 
               here for two and a half years?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case 
               of party poppers I'm gonna keep
<b> 
</b>               in front of 'em.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer exits. George has taken one of the chairs, unfolded it, 
               and is sat with
<b> 
</b>               his feet up on the back of the couch, hands behind his head.
<b> 
</b><b>

               morning from one of the Mets front
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, 
               Jerry. They probably wanna pick my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               brains.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (thoughtful) I have no idea.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters, throws her bag on the table. She's in a bad mood.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b>               Elaine gets another of the folding chairs.

<b>               
</b>               Mrs Hamilton leans back on the couch beside Jerry. She's sitting 
               uncomfortably

               of the couch
<b> 
</b>               behind Jerry. (To cut it short, this scene plays pretty close

               in for a second
<b> 
</b>               before she moves back out of sight. Then, a be-suited Kramer 
               is pushed into
<b> 
</b>               sight. He enters the store, smoking a cigar.

<b>

               to some.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer strolls over to a rack and grabs a selection of a half-dozen 
               items. He
<b> 
</b>               then heads for the changing room.

</b>               He pulls the curtain shut. The sound of a pricing gun can be 
               heard. The clicking
<b> 
</b>               goes on for a couple of seconds, and then the gun is dropped. 
               It lands by
<b> 
</b>               Kramer's feet and breaks, Kramer then exacerbates his problem 
               by kicking the gun
<b> 
</b>               as he tries to retrieve it.

<b>               
</b>               George is driving his car in a circle in the parking lot. Trailing 
               behind the
<b> 
</b>               car, on a rope, is a trophy which bounces and clatters on the 
               tarmac. George is
<b> 
</b>               leaning out of the car window, with a megaphone.

               are browsing the

</b>               racks. Elaine enters and, holding her hand up to hide her face, 
               she walks over
<b>

</b>               There's a knock at the door. Jerry opens it to reveal Newman.

</b>               Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you 
               say to Elaine? I just got her
<b> 
</b>               cancellation in the mail.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, well I guess she found some place 
               better to go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Well, it's her mistake. Because she 
               is going to miss the party of a
<b> 
</b>               lifetime.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when 
               she's looking for someone warm
<b> 
</b>               and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon 
               and New York City.

</b><b>                             NEWMAN

</b>               Jerry too, of course.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               (reluctant) You don't wanna do your...

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Alright then, I guess I can accept a 
               little Jerry, if it gets me a
<b> 
</b>               (suggestive) lot of Elaine.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry pulls a disgusted face.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Deal?

</b><b>                             NEWMAN

</b>               (grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer and Newman move to the door to leave. Newman stops as 
               Jerry speaks to
<b> 
</b>               him, and Kramer exits to his apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               By the way Newman, I'm just curious. 
               When you booked the hotel, did you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               book it for the millennium New Year?

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               (smug) As a matter of fact, I did.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone 
               knows, since there was no
<b> 
</b>               year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand 
               and one.
<b> 
</b>               Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument. His face twitches 
               as he realises
<b> 
</b>               his error.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Aww!

<b>               
</b>               Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration - a sort of 
               half-strangulated
<b> 
</b>               nasal squeak. He then waddles away after Kramer.
