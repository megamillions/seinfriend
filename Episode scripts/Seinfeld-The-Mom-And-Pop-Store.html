</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I like the names they have for cars. 
               Like, no baron has ever owned a LeBaron. 
               Or the Ford LTD. "LTD." Limited. It's 
               a "limited" edition...what did they 
               make, fifty million of those? "Yes, 
               it's 'limited' to the number we can 
               sell." Or when they try and mangle a 
               positive word into a car name, you know 
               how they'll do that? The "Integra." 
               Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The "Supra." 
               Or the "Impreza." Yeah? Well, I hope 
               it's not a "lemona"...or you'll be hearing 
               from my "lawya."

               Volvo.)
<b>

</b><b>                             CAR SALESMAN
</b>               George, are you sure I can't show you 
               any other cars?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't think so, Vic. I've done my 
               homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car 
               for me, it's the one I want.
<b>

</b><b>                             SALESMAN
</b>               I got a LeBaron convertible right here.

</b><b>                             SALESMAN
</b>               It's got a few more miles on it, but 
               the previous owner was John Voight.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Jon Voight?

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone 
               with Tim Whatley.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Was that Tim Whatley?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, it was. He wanted your address 
               - you, my friend, are going to be invited 
               to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. 
               (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, 
               then gleefully struts her way to the 
               kitchen.) You know, he's got that great 
               apartment on 77th street, and they overlook 
               where they inflate all those huge balloons 
               for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I have always had a big crush on Tim 
               Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates 
               this by shoving Jerry.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to 
               go out with a dentist.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He'll always be criticizing your brushing 
               technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics 
               brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... 
               (The door opens a little, George jangles 
               the keys to his new car at Jerry and 
               Elaine, then enters.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh - new car!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey! Did you get the Volvo?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought Consumer said Volvo was the 
               car.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, maybe so...but it was good enough 
               for Mr. Jon Voight.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jon Voight? The actor?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's right. He just happened to be 
               the previous owner of the vehicle.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You bought a car because it belonged 
               to Jon Voight?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no...

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think yes, yes. You like the idea 
               of telling people you're driving Jon 
               Voight's car.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright, maybe I do. So what.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I've never even seen him in a car. I 
               mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance 
               - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway 
               Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)

               Pop store? Let me tell you something. 
               If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't 
               shop there.

               so, he becomes our seventh person to 
               land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker 
               balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day 
               Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is 
               intrigued; mouths the words "Woody Woodpecker.") 
               There are only three spots left. We're 
               going to take a little break now; when 
               we come back, you'll have three more 
               chances to win a spot holding a rope 
               under Woody Woodpecker.

               us to participate in any activities 
               that he thought were associated with 
               the common man. The Thanksgiving Day

               Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.

               then slowly moves through the crowd, covering his face to keep 
               a low profile.
