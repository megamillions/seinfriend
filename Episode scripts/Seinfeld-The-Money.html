<b>                             THE MONEY
</b>


                             Written by

                           Peter Mehlman




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Kramer's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Kramer and Emily are in bed, having just finished their lovemaking. 
               They're
<b> 
</b>               both looking very satisfied and smiling.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, that was alright, huh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             EMILY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, um, goodnight.

<b>               
</b><b>                             EMILY
</b>               Goodnight.

<b>               
</b>               snuggles up to him and puts an arm around him. Kramer doesn't 
               look
<b> 
</b>               comfortable with this.

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer's Apartment, Later)

<b>               
</b><b>                             THE CLOCK READS 3
</b>               31. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. 
               Beside him,
<b> 
</b>               Emily lies face-down, sleeping, with her arms flung out wide. 
               One hand is on
<b> 
</b>               the pillow above Kramer's head, then it moves and Emily's forearm 
               runs
<b> 
</b>               across Kramer's face, waking him. Kramer looks disgruntled at 
               being
<b> 
</b>               awakened.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (quietly, to himself) Look at this.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               He picks up Emily's hand and moves it back to the pillow behind 
               his head,
<b> 
</b>               only for the same thing to happen again. Emily's hand moves across 
               his face.
<b> 
</b>               Kramer looks unhappy at the disturbance.

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer's Apartment, Later Still)

<b>               
</b><b>                             THE CLOCK READS 5
</b>               11. A wide awake Kramer is right over 
               to the edge of the
<b> 
</b>               bed, with Emily cuddled up to him, sleeping happily. Kramer tries 
               to
<b> 
</b>               carefully move, so as to not wake Emily, but as he shifts his 
               weight, he
<b> 
</b>               slips off the end of the mattress and falls to the floor. Emily 
               rolls into
<b> 
</b>               the space vacated, continuing to sleep.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and his parents enter, carrying a selection of luggage.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Jerry, we can only stay four days.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the 
               most of it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Morty and Helen remove their coats.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               Helen, did you pack my travel gym?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought 
               a exercise device off the
<b> 
</b>               television. He does it every morning at four.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               Only twenty-five minutes a day, and 
               you can attach it to any
<b> 
</b>               doorknob.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are 
               about to expire.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry carries two cases through into the bedroom as his parents 
               sit on the
<b> 
</b>               couch.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to 
               talk to you about something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry reenters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Am I finally getting a baby brother?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Jerry, be serious.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               It's too much car, Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about 
               the Northstar system?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               I don't think we even use it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, it's a gift and I want you to 
               keep it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               We already sold it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wh..why didn't you tell me before you 
               sold it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry turns away towards the kitchen as Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Morty, dressed in exercise gear, emerges from the bedroom. He 
               is carrying
<b> 
</b>               the travel gym. He creeps across the room, so as not to wake 
               Jerry, who is
<b> 
</b>               asleep on the couch, quietly opens the door and slips outside.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer is asleep in his bed, when something wakes him. He can 
               hear a
<b> 
</b>               thumping and a rattling sound. Kramer turns over and looks across 
               at his
<b> 
</b>               door, to see the handle turning, as if someone outside were trying 
               to open
<b> 
</b>               it. A look of horror comes to Kramer's face.

<b>               
</b>               Outside in the hallway, Morty has his travel gym attached to 
               Kramer's
<b> 
</b>               doorknob. As he pulls on the arrangement of cords and pulleys, 
               they in turn
<b> 
</b>               pull at the doorknob.

<b>               
</b>               Inside Kramer's apartment, a terrified Kramer pulls the blankets 
               over his
<b> 
</b>               head and lies quivering underneath.

</b>               The front portion of the Cadillac is submerged in a swamp, with

               for us? He's not getting
<b> 
</b>               away with that.

<b>               
</b>               It's revealed that the Seinfelds are in a trailer parked behind 
               the
<b> 
</b>               Cadillac.
