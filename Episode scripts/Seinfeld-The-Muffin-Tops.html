<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               New clothes?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new

               I borrow your menu?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Strange. For new pants, there's noticable 
               wear on the buttocks of those chinos. 
               Wait those are the clothes from the 
               bag!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right, let me ask you something: 
               When do you start to worry about ear

</b><b>                             JERRY

               Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, 
               you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you 
               this: Do you know where Walker Street 
               is downtown? I've got a league meeting 
               there.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Where are you meeting these women? When 
               they get off the bus at the port authority?
<b> 
</b><b>

               to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll 
               find the biggest dating scene in the 
               world.

</b>               Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're 
               going to extend the tour at no extra charge.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (looking at a map) I don't know. (over 
               the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Banjo music plays as they look for garbage dumps.

<b>               
</b>               Next scene. Kramer argues with someone at a dump.

<b>               
</b>               Next scene. A man vomits on the floor.

<b>               
</b>               Next scene. Kramer is driving. He is sleepy. His head nods down 
               onto the horn. The horn blows. Startled, Kramer sits back up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Banjo music finishes.

</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               So, the New York Yankees traded you 
               for a bunch of Tyler chicken.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken 
               drink.

</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch 
               my clothes?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             MAN
</b>               These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               On Kramer's bus.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer 
               how much longer? My chest hair is comming 
               back and it's itching me like crazy. 
               I can't let her see me scratch it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Don't worry. I've got a good feeling 
               about this dump.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer gets off the bus, carrying a garbage bag.

<b>               
</b>               Eerie music is playing. Jerry looks out the bus window at a full 
               moon. A dog starts barking.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think 
               I'll go play with that dog.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I don't know where the tops are.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry runs past Kramer and another person. Eerie music still 
               playing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Jerry what's the matter?

<b>               
</b>               In slow motion Jerry runs into the woods. At normal speed he 
               runs behind a tree. Camera shot down on him as he starts scratching 
               his chest.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (for the first half of the howl, a dog 
               howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, 
               that feels good.

</b>               (talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta 
               bring me some clothes down here. I lost 
               my job with the Yankees. I'm standing 
               in the men's room on 43rd street in 
               my underpants.

</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               All right, I'm going to need a clean 
               8 ounce glass.

</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               If I'm curt, then I appologize. But 
               as I understand it, we have a situation 
               here and time is of the essence.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets 
               down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 
               4 bottles of milk and sets them down.
