</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I've always been a big fan of the little 
               check move. You
<b> 
</b>               know. Unless the waiter's not too sharp, then you got to total
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it up. Sometimes they have to come over, "Do you want the

               check?" "No, I want to be pen pals. Can't you see what I'm

               doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people."

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hmm!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Fantastic!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I told you. How good is this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How good?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Very good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               They got blue berries. And there's real 
               blue berries. What
<b> 
</b>               kind did you get?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Coffee. And they grind up the coffee 
               beans, and they put it
<b> 
</b>               in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Let me test-taste that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Huh? Huh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hmm! Rico!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Suave! And it's non-fat!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               See, how could this not have any fat? 
               It's too good.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You want to taste mine?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, you want to taste mine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I don't.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Okay, if you want to taste mine, you 
               don't have to offer me
<b> 
</b>               some of yours.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               All right, let's just forget it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, Kramer's going to clean up 
               on this place.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He invested in it.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No kidding?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. 
               This is so

</b>               *beep*ing good.

</b>               Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something 
               to you. Now,
<b> 
</b>               cursing is not something that most comedians do.

<b>               
</b>               Son You did it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's true. But it was an accident. 
               And I haven't done it
<b> 
</b>               since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue

               cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you

               grow up. Excuse me one second.

               one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a

</b><b>                             NEWS
</b>               Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical 
               last week, received
<b> 
</b>               some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another

               development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag

               fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Giuliani is about to make a statement.

</b><b>                             GIULIANI
</b>               It's hard to understand. Because I've 
               been doing everything I
<b> 
</b>               normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I

               exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani 
               and he doesn't even

</b>               Well, we've got to do something. I'm 
               calling Giuliani's
<b> 
</b>               headquarters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an 
               idiot thinks
<b> 
</b>               anybody would be interested in an idea like that.

<b>               
</b>               Dad I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are

               you doing, Joe?" Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought

               you said it went away.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I banged it on the desk in the doctor's 
               office. And . . .
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MOM
</b>               Be quiet. They're starting the press 
               conference.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very disturbing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm

               elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do

               everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               yogurt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, 
               this is terrible.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Phew!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, it stinks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Mine, too. I got one more day.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I can't eat this.

<b>               
</b>               Newman Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It had fat in it, it's not good for 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Newman I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               even with you for this. You can count on it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen 
               to this. Apparently
<b> 
</b>               some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               election for the Republican. It was the one issue which

               seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, in effect, the yogurt won him the 
               election.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I wonder what actually happened in that 
               lab.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, me, too.

<b>               
</b>               Newman I can't eat this.

<b>               
</b><b>                             BOY
</b>               Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, 
               you fat *beep*!
