<b>                              THE NOTE
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. 
               "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They
               can't all be the best. 
<b> 
</b>               There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom 
               of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying 
               to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah,
               he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got,
               it'll be worse after you see him. 
<b> 
</b>               He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's 
               always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." 
               Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! 
               Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."

</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry is getting a massage.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               ...And usually for lunch I'll have a 
               salad, and for dinner, I eat
<b> 
</b>               whatever I want.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What do you think the worst part of 
               being blind is?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Excuse me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, if you were blind what do 
               you think the worst part of it would
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               be?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think it would be not being able to 
               tell if there was bugs in my food. 
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be 
               feeling around
<b> 
</b>               with my lips and my tongue.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Well that's how my five-year old eats. 
               He's a very picky eater.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You hear about that kid that was kidnapped 
               the other day in
<b> 
</b>               Pennsylvania?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He was at a carnival with his mother. 
               She goes to get a hot dog, next
<b> 
</b>               thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Oh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Imagine how sick a person has to be 
               to do something like that. And
<b> 
</b>               these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, 
               I could be one
<b> 
</b>               of these people.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Have you seen any good movies?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who takes care of your boy during the 
               day?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No no. I'm just saying.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               She had references.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. 
               I'm talking about the
<b> 
</b>               ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               I don't live near here, ya know!

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So she's giving me the massage and I'm 
               just making conversation.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't like to talk during a massage.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Neither do I, but I do it for them. 
               I figure they're bored.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about 
               getting the pleasure. I feel
<b> 
</b>               like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying 
               it. There's
<b> 
</b>               nothing to eat in here.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well so she mentioned that she had a 
               son, and the for some reason I
<b> 
</b>               launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was 
               abducted.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She doesn't want to hear that, that

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can't believe you said that.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, would you stop it already?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, what did she say?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know, she actually seemed to 
               get a little paranoid.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This is terrible. What is this, ginger? 
               I hate ginger. I can't
<b> 
</b>               understand how anyone can eat ginger.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I have a good masseuse you could go 
               to.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, she's really good and she's not 
               just a masseuse, she's a physical
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, 
               it's a real
<b> 
</b>               medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's 
               covered by
<b> 
</b>               insurance.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not if you have a doctor's note.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So where do you get this note?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I've never actually done it but 
               if I really wanted to I could
<b> 
</b>               probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             RECEPTIONIST
</b>               That's right.

<b>               
</b>               George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't get a massage from a man.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What, are you crazy? I can't have a

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I don't want the man either.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What's the difference, you're a woman. 
               They're supposed to be touching
<b> 
</b>               you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He'd just be touching your back.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He'd just be touching your back too.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know. That's the point. If it's gonna 
               get sexual, it should get
<b> 
</b>               sexual with you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I wouldn't be comfortable.

<b>               
</b>               A man walks up dressed in white.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               George?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I'm Raymond.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hello.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Are you ready?

<b>               
</b>               George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George

<b> 
</b>               uncomfortable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted

</b>               office.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I used to be a flight attendant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh boy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Ya know, why don't you open those pants, 
               it's gonna be a lot easier
<b> 
</b>               that way.

<b>               
</b>               George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down 
               his hips then
<b> 
</b>               starts massaging his lower back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               So what do you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I said, 'What do you do?'.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND

</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Okay, just take off those pants now, 
               I'll work the hamstring.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, the hamstring's fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               But you wrote that it was tender.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I'll check it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Are you sure?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Yeah, take 'em off.

<b>               
</b>               George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond 
               rubbing his
<b> 
</b>               hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs 
               back on the
<b> 
</b>               table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid 
               with
<b> 
</b>               discomfort.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He was... touching and rubbing.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's a massage.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And then I took my pants off.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You took your pants off?

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think it moved.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Moved?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It may have moved, I don't know.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm sure it didn't move.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It moved! It was imperceptible but I 
               felt it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe it just wanted to change positions? 
               You know, shift to the other
<b> 
</b>               side.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, 
               this was a move.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay, so what if it moved?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's the sign! The test; if a man 
               makes it move.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's not the test. Contact is the 
               test, if it moves as a result of
<b> 
</b>               contact.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You think it's contact? It has to be 
               touched?

</b>               See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               I'm uh, you know, like I'm
<b> 
</b>               sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, 
               you know, to uh,
<b> 
</b>               look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* 
               (slams the
<b> 
</b>               table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing 
               these yelping
<b> 
</b>               noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction 
               because
<b> 
</b>               the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything 
               that's going on
<b> 
</b>               around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like 
               he hits.

<b> 
</b>               (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) They called 
               me a Mary. So I
<b> 
</b>               chased them, and I tripped and I fell.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations

</b>               Men have been popping into my sexual

<b> 
</b>               be in the middle.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. 
               I say "Get out of here! 
<b> 
</b>               What do you want? You don't belong here!"

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They talk back. They go, "Hey George, 
               how's it going?" I say, "Get
<b> 
</b>               the hell out of here!"

<b>               
</b>               Jerry spots Kramer through the window.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the 
               glass to get Kramer's attention) 
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer enters and sits at the booth.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I just came from Roy's. I threw up from 
               the gas.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The three all put down their coffee cups simultaneously.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did he say anything?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No no, he's fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh my god, it's...

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Joe DiMaggio.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Having a cup of coffee.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He's dunking!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. 
               Here.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               (Elaine and Jerry look right at
<b> 
</b>               George) Oh please.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Wait, wait. *bang* (he slams his hand 
               down on the table) *bang*
<b> 
</b>               (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* See? 
               I told you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Closing monologue)

<b>               
</b>               What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual 
               man worry? I 
               think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales 
               resistance. We're 
               constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. 
               Men think, 
               "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally 
               wander into 
               some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and 
               the salesman 
               goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little 
               bit, see how 
               you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you 
               like to see him in a sandal?'"
