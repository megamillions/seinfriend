</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               A mute would be good.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, they say all it is is that you 
               go over to their apartment and,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee 
               and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it's supposed to make them feel good.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's what I do with him (points at
