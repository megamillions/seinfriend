<b>                             THE OPERA
</b>

</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that 
               men are all the
<b> 
</b>               same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding 
               is like
<b> 
</b>               the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. 
               The tuxedo
<b> 
</b>               is a wedding safety device created by women because they know 
               that men are
<b> 
</b>               undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just 
               takes one
<b> 
</b>               step over and she marries the next guy. That's why the wedding 
               vow isn't 'do
<b> 
</b>               you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.

               I have a hair on my

               you do,

</b>               The hardest part about being a clown,

<b> 
</b>               you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", 
               "I'm not
<b> 
</b>               working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's 
               a clown!".
<b> 
</b>               How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that 
               you want to
<b> 
</b>               be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look 
               so bad, it's
<b> 
</b>               actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations 
               done.
<b> 
</b>               Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus 
               around them,
<b> 
</b>               is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat

<b>               
</b>               Man #3 enters and shuffles to his seat.

</b>               Susan comes in from the other side.

<b>

<b>                             MAN#3

<b>                             SUSAN
</b>               He decided not to come. He said he was 
               uncomfortable.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uncomfortable? How does you think I 
               feel?.. Hey let me ask you
<b> 
</b>               something, how much did you pay for that ticket?

<b>                             MAN#3
</b>               One seventy-five.

<b>                             JERRY

<b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Some nut in a clown suit!

<b>               
</b>               The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look 
               very

</b>               I had some friends drag me to an opera 
               recently, you know how
<b> 
</b>               they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really 
               need
<b> 
</b>               binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before 
               you can spot
<b> 
</b>               'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty,

               three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the 
               women have
<b> 
</b>               like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. 
               If you
<b> 
</b>               can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, 
               maybe that's more you're thing.
