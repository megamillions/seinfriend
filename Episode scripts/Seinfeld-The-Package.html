</b>               (Elaine at the doctor's)

<b>               
</b><b>                             ATTENDANT

</b><b>                             ELAINE 
</b>               Difficult ?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DOCTOR 
</b>               Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that.
               So tell me about this rash of yours.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE 
</b>               Well it's , it's..... You know I noticed 
               that somebody wrote in my chart that I was
               difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell 
               you that I remember that appointment exactly.
               You see this nurse asked me to put a gown             
               on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I 
               specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have
               to put a gown on. You know they're made of paper.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DOCTOR 
</b>               Well that was a long time ago. How 
               about if I just erase it. Now               
               about that rash...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE 
</b>               But it was in pen. You fake erase.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DOCTOR 
</b>               All right Miss Benes. This doesn't 
               look too serious. You'll be fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE 
</b>               What are you writing? Doctor.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
