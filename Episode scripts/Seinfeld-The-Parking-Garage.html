</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why do I always have the feeling that

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               This is what people do.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No they don't. They're out on some big 
               picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're 
               making out on blankets. They're not 
               at some mall in Jersey watching their 
               friends trying to find the world's cheapest 
               air-conditioner.

</b>               You should see what my father used to 
               go through before he bought a car. He'd 
               go from state to state. He was away 
               for weeks at a time. It was like he 
               was running for President and he was 
               going through the primaries. We'd get 
               phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
