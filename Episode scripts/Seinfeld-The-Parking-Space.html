</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, 
               isn't that
<b> 
</b>               discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass 
               hanging out of
<b> 
</b>               the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people 
               out there
<b> 
</b>               with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping 
               them. Nobody
<b> 
</b>               goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't 
               pull that in
<b> 
</b>               there."

<b>               
</b>               Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. 
               I think your car got stolen
<b> 
</b>               again.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What are you talking about?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well you parked it on eighty-fourth 
               and Columbus, right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yep, well I just walked by there and 
               that car is gone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh yeah, I know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, where is it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the difference?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, there's no difference, you know, 
               I'm just curious.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You always have to know everything that's 
               going on, don't you?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What happened to the car?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If I don't tell you it will kill you, 
               won't it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You have to know, you must know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I must know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I'm not telling you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, come on.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nope. I don't think so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, please?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not today, pal.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Okay, I beg you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make 
               it a real beg. You gotta put
<b> 
</b>               some beg into it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Okay, please! Please tell me!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging 
               needs a lot of work.

</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I loaned the car to George.

</b>               Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses 
               and this

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well I'm very disappointed in George

<b> 
</b>               somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b>               problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for

<b>

               He had some pretty

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               No no no, that's no good. No, I really 
               don't think that's a beg. No,
<b> 
</b>               it's close, but uh...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b>               confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well you can't just mention it and then 
               not tell me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Alright. I'll tell you but you can't 
               say anything to him.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm not saying anything, I'm putting

<b> 
</b>               vault, it's a vault!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               He thinks you're a phony.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He what?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I told you, he thinks you're a phony.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A phony? He called me a phony?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               A big phone. A big one.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why did you tell me that if I can't 
               say anything?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You begged me.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now 
               making a clanking
<b> 
</b>               noise.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Do you hear that?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Of course I hear that.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You had to move the mirror?

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
<b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't 
               there. You threw off my
<b> 
</b>               equilibrium.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh yeah, blame it on me because you

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b>               no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from

<b> 
</b>               Watch this.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'm sure you could.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What are we gonna tell Jerry about the

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright, start looking for spaces.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, you're never gonna find a space 
               on Jerry's block, just put it in a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               garage.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Look, I have my system. First I look 
               for the dream spot right in front
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh come on, George, please put it in 
               a garage. I don't want to spend
<b> 
</b>               an hour looking for a space.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't park in a garage.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in 
               my family can pay for parking,
<b> 
</b>               it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, 
               my brother,
<b> 
</b>               nobody. We can't do it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'll pay for it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You don't understand. A garage. I can't 
               even pull in there. It's
<b> 
</b>               like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply 
               myself, maybe I
<b> 
</b>               could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do 
               you want? Go
<b> 
</b>               around me, I'm looking for spaces.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh George, there's a space right there!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come 
               true, what did
<b> 
</b>               I tell you?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You didn't even have to take it out 
               to dinner.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               They share a laugh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel 
               parking. (spitting into
<b> 
</b>               his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make 
               a living
<b> 
</b>               parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, 
               knowing all
<b> 
</b>               the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing 
               it back in,
<b> 
</b>               that's the key.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Will you just park it already?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               There's nothing I can even impart to 
               you, that's the sad thing. It's
<b> 
</b>               so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) 
               Look at this
<b> 
</b>               guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing 
               my space!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               George, wait, you don't know who this 
               guy is, people kill for a parking
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               space in this city.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No no no, he's not getting away with 
               this.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               George?

<b>               
</b>               George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, what are you doing?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               I think I'm parking my car.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You can't do that, you can't just sneak 
               in from the back like that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know 
               you were parking, you were just
<b> 
</b>               sitting there three spaces up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well if you didn't think I was parking, 
               why did you put it in head
<b> 
</b>               first?

<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

<b> 
</b>               way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe 
               it. (pushing a
<b> 
</b>               bag of chips off the counter)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Tell me what happened.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted 
               and
<b> 
</b>               the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, 
               this pack of
<b> 
</b>               extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And 
               for some
<b> 
</b>               reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then 
               we payed the
<b> 
</b>               toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow 
               us, alright?!
<b> 
</b>               So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this 
               really like a
<b> 
</b>               souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really 
               suddenly and the
<b> 
</b>               car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George 
               is such a
<b> 
</b>               great driver.

<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired 
               a gun right up in the air.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I think it was a gun. And then they 
               followed us all the way into the
<b> 
</b>               city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they 
               went home.

               The forty percent was too much

               putting it in a garage. The

               Well I'm

               not putting up

               started. I'm going upstairs,
<b> 
</b>               who's coming? Elaine?

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I still don't have to go.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No. Don't, Jerry.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! 
               Jerry! First of all, I think
<b> 
</b>               you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary 
               way. I
<b> 
</b>               mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's 
               good, sort of
<b> 
</b>               thing? You know, slang.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Use it in a sentence.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. 
               (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             MIKE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             COP #1

<b> 
</b>               minutes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Officer, he can't pull in head first.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               sitting there.

<b>               
</b><b>                             COP #1

<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             COP #2
</b>               Wait a second. Why can't he go in head 
               first? He said the guy was
<b> 
</b>               just sitting over there.

<b>               
</b><b>                             COP #1
</b>               What are you talking about? This guy

</b><b>                             COP #2

</b><b>                             COP #1

</b><b>                             COP #2

<b>               
</b>               Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard 
               arguing
<b> 
</b>               through the window.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, you're gonna have to go to the 
               bathroom!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't have a job!

<b>               
</b><b>                             MIKE
</b>               Neither do I!

<b>               
</b>               Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the 
               remote and turns
<b> 
</b>               on the TV.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.

<b>               
</b>               People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because 
               they think,
<b> 
</b>               'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 
               'I'll be
<b> 
</b>               circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' 
               I think because
<b> 
</b>               everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars 
               than parking
<b> 
</b>               spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. 
               It's like
<b> 
</b>               Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem 
               is car
<b> 
</b>               manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars 
               every year, they're
<b> 
</b>               not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working 
               on. Wouldn't
<b> 
</b>               that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving 
               turntable,
<b> 
</b>               and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.
