</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have never seen an old person in a 
               new bathing suit in my life. I don't 
               know where they get their bathing suits, 
               but my father has bathing suits from 
               other centuries. My parents live in 
               Florida, and if you go down there and 
               you forget your bathing suits then they 
               want you to wear one of theirs. You 
               know how that gets? "You need trunks 
               son? I've got trunks for you. You can 
               wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear 
               bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's 
               kind of the same thing a tree would 
               wear if it went swimming. So I get in 
               the water with in thing and it's like 
               floating around me somewhere. Did you 
               ever put on a bathing suit that you 
               don't even know exactly where you are 
               inside the bathing suit? You bump into 
               somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, 
               I'm waiting for the boat to come back."

               the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything 
               around here.

</b><b>                             EVELYN
</b>               (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I don't think so.

</b><b>                             EVELYN
</b>               Because my nephew Larry could do it. 
               He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack 
               has no case.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I'll ask him when he gets up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             EVELYN
</b>               Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says 
               that according to the bylaws of the 
               condo constitution, they need six votes 
               to throw you out for unruly behavior. 
               Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one 
               you'll have to suck up to.

</b><b>                             EVELYN

               It's like two days really. It's like
