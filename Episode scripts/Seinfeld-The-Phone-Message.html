<b>                         THE PHONE MESSAGE
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television 
               is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see 
               anybody on TV
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip 
               crumbs on their
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have 
               you seen them?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               "We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, 
               flying through
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there 
               and you're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're 
               advertising
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm 
               putting too much
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ice in mine."

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So then, as we were leaving, we were 
               just kind of standing there,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted 
               me to ask her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. 
               Sometimes I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't 
               know if I'm
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood 
               there like -
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy 
               line? - that's what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I looked like.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you didn't ask?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I froze.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Points to counter) Counter.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour 
               later I'm back in the office,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call 
               her". I says "I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask 
               a woman out I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they 
               break the bricks.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               So Lloyd calls me a wuss.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He said wuss?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you called. (They sit at counter)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right. And, and to cover my nervousness 
               I started eating an apple,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of 
               the phone, it
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               makes you sound casual.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, like a farm boy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right. So I call her up, I tell her 
               it's me, she gives me an
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               enthusiastic 'Hi!'

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', 
               I'm outta there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright, so you're chewing your apple, 
               you got your enthusiastic
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               'Hi!' Go ahead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So, we're talking, and I don't like 
               to go too long before I ask them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out 
               "What are you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               doing Saturday night?"

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She bought.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Great day in the morning.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Then I got off the phone right away.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you 
               don't loiter around in front of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit 
               and get out.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's amazing: we, we both have dates 
               on the same night. I can't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               remember the last time that happened.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George 
               and his date
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't stand doing laundry. That's 
               why I have forty pairs of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               underwear.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               You do not.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Absolutely. Because instead of doing 
               a wash, I just keep buying
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. 
               That way, I
<b>

</b><b>               
</b>               could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit 
               on a porch and

</b>               wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

               have to do with

</b><b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, why? I love it when guys call me 
               the next day.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Of course you do, but you're imagining 
               a guy you like, not a guy who
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               goes (in stupid voice) "Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." 
               If I call
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy.

<b>               
</b>               Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, 
               a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               kaiser, a tsar.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               All she'll think is that you like her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, she wants me to like her, if she 
               likes me, but she doesn't like
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               me!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know what your parents did to 
               you.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, I just thought of a really funny 
               thing for your act. Alright,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you're up there, you're on the stage and you go "Hey, you ever 
               notice how cars
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances 
               anymore.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, 
               sorry buddy,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes 
               and sauages
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'" So you 
               gonna use it?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't think so.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>               
</b>               see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me

</b><b>               
</b>               around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing 
               is, I see him all
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the time.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All the time.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               It's nice to meet you.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hi.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna 
               eat?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know, we could go uptown, and that 
               way we could give Jerry a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ride home.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you 
               park?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Don't you wanna go upstairs first?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               No, what for? I'll just give my bag 
               to the doorman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, I really need to use the bathroom.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee 
               shop just next door.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, 
               so...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Well they have a phone.

<b>               
</b>               (George takes Carol to one side)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know Jerry. He has this phobia about 
               public toilets. I think we
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               really should go upstairs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               (Aloud) You know, I think I will go 
               upstairs. I can check my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               machine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right, right.

<b>               
</b>               (They enter building)

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               The bathroom's on the hall to the right.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Er, you know, why don't you go first, 
               you just had a long trip.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               No, I'm fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest 
               thing, it went away.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Oh that's weird.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've 
               read about that in medical
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               journals. It's a freak thing, but...

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Well, let me just check my messages, 
               and we'll go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? 
               Right now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Sure.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Please, this is very, very important. 
               (Leads her to other room)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry goes over to machine to switch tape)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Shouts from other room) Uhh, tippy 
               toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Carol reappears followed by George)

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're 
               a comedian. I've seen
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you, it's driving me crazy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right. I am.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, 
               just for a moment, if
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.

<b>               
</b>               (George leads Carol back out, Jerry switches tapes)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George and Carol return)

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               That's what you had to tell me? Your 
               father wears sneakers in the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pool?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Well, I'll just check my machine and 
               we'll go. No, nothing here,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today 
               my neighbour
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, uhhh...

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking 
               up. I just love jokes
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               like that.

<b>               
</b>               (All three leave)

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish 
               if I saw
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go "Excuse 
               me, I'm not
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk 
               away." I also
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because 
               you can't slam
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone 
               - "You can't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               talk to me like that!" Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody 
               on a cordless
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               phone - "You can't talk to me like that!" (Mimes fiddly button-pressing) 
<b>               "I
</b><b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               told him!"

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                                 THE END
