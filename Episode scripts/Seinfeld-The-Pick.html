               some volunteer work for that Church

               I like about the holiday season. That's 
               the true spirit of Christmas. People 
               being helped by people other than me. 
               That makes me feel good inside. Look 
               at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas 
               card from Laine. You didn't have to 
               go to all that trouble.
