<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               Oh no, I've had just enough.

<b>               
</b>               (Waitress brings dessert)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Here we go... apple pie! Best apple 
               pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) 
               Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. 
               Take some.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No thanks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're not gonna have any?

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No (with a disgusted face)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Do you not like apple pie?

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No, it's not that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, at least taste it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No (a resolute "no")

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You won't even taste it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her 
               head doing "no") A little taste! (still 
               shaking) Come on! (still shaking)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (scene ends)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's appartment, the next day)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry and George)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Did she say why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. She wouldn't say anything. She just 
               kept shaking her head like this (Imitating 
               Audrey)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe she's diabetic.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts 
               in her purse.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe you said something that offended 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The only thing I can think of is I told 
               her we should have those moving walkways 
               all over the city.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They never try anything.

</b>               (to the gang) There's a clothing store 
               downtown. They got a mannequin in there 
               that looks exactly like Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's uncanny! It's like they chopped 
               off your arms and legs, dipped you in 
               plastic, and screwed you back all together, 
               and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really 
               quite exquisite.

</b>               Audrey, I got to be honest with you. 
               I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. 
               I need to know things. Not tasting the 
               apple pie the other day, I can't get 
               past it. You obviously like pies. You 
               carry doughnuts in your bag, you're 
               not averse to pastry. Surely you could 
               see how such a thing would prey on my 
               mind.

</b><b>                             MACKENZIE
</b>               No, no, no. He got fired because he 
               wasn't a team player. That's something 
               we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll 
               find we're team here George. We don't 
               tolerate dissent. If you want to go 
               your own way, you're in the wrong place.
