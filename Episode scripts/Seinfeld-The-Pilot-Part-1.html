<b>                          THE PILOT PART 1
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               To me, the whole concept of fear of 
               success is proof that we are definitely 
               scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. 
               Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings 
               for these people? They'll go: "Hi, my 
               name is Bill, and the one thing I'm 
               worried about is to have a stereo and 
               a cream-colored couch." According to 
               most studies, people's number-one fear 
               is public speaking. Number two is death. 
               *Death* is number two! Now, this means 
               to the average person, if you have to 
               go to a funeral, you're better off in 
               the casket than doing the eulogy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry is entering his apartment, following by Kramer)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Why can't I play Kramer?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Look we've been through this already. 
               You're not an actor!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Neither are you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I know. So why do we need two people 
               in the show that can't act?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to 
               act. You say something, I'll pretend 
               it's funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               My grandmother's in the hospital.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the 
               hospital!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               This is real believable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What you didn't think I was really laughing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It stinks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Let me see you do it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Say something funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Alright. I've never been to Mars but 
               I imagine it's quite lovely.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah..........

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Mine was better than that! Come on look. 
               (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George enters while they're both laughing)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why are two pretending to be laughing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We're acting. (they stop laughing)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, real good. (George makes a face 
               like: you stink) Any word from NBC?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't understand. They're supposed 
               to be casting this week. Something's 
               wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (to George) He wants to play Kramer 
               in the Pilot.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to George) Yeah!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Out of the question.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oughh!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? 
               What's with this Russel? What's he doing? 
               (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders 
               like: he doesn't know)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (scene ends)

<b>               
</b>               (Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant)

<b>               
</b>               (Elaine and Russell are sitting down at a table)

<b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               I really appreciate you coming.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time 
               though. So...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               All right, first of all, I want to apologize 
               for all the phone calls. It's just--It's 
               just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, 
               we went out once...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That was two months ago.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you 
               out of my mind. Ever since that-- that 
               day in the restaurant when we met... 
               (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' 
               of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking 
               Russell for his Ketchup secret)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Russell, you are the president of NBC. 
               You can have any woman you want. (picks 
               up the bowl of munchies on the table)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               But I want you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               God I hate these mixtures. Why don't 
               they just put pretzels on the table. 
               Even peanuts would be good, but I don't 
               know how eats these cheesy things (she 
               does).
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Is it something I said... or did?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Um... Look Russell... You're a very 
               sweet guy. But I got to be honest with 
               you. I don't like television... and 
               that's your world. That's your life.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I mean look at this. Every waitress

<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know what? That's discriminatory. 
               That is unfair. Why should these women 
               have all the advantages? It's not enough 
               they get all the attention from men, 
               they have to get all the waitress jobs, 
               too?

</b>               How could you be a doctor and not say 
               "get outta here"? It should be part 
               of the training at medical school: "Cancer? 
               Get outta here!" "Go home! What are 
               you crazy? It's a little test. It's 
               nothing. You're a real nut. You know 
               that?" (Jerry gives him half of his 
               sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I 
               told you that God would never let me 
               be successful. I never should've written 
               that pilot. Now the show will be a big 
               hit, we'll make millions of dollars, 
               and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because 
               of this. (showing his lip)
