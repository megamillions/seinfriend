<b>                          THE PILOT PART 2
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (NBC, pilot's set)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry, Tom, and Michael are at the counter, rehearsing. George 
               is standing and watching them next to another guy. Rita, Jay, 
               Stu and Russell are sitting in the crowd's bleachers)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOM
</b>               What do you mean made up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. 
               It's not Danish.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOM
</b>               You're crazy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is 
               Haagen-Dazs Danish?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MICHAEL
</b>               What do you mean Danish?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. 
               (speaking of Michael)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Danish. Is it from Denmark?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MICHAEL
</b>               No, they make it in New Jersey. It's 
               just a Danishy name.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOM
</b>               I can't believe that. They fooled *me* 
               Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RITA
</b>               (to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about 
               nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, 
               smiles stupidly)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) 
               Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in 
               charge of yelling: "take #!") This--This 
               is not right. May I? (the guy looks 
               at George with a bothered face. George 
               then walks up to Tom and takes him away 
               from Jerry and Michael to talk to him 
               in private)(to Tom) You see, you're 
               going: "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George 
               shakes his head with disapproval) You 
               wanna hit 'fooled' more: "They *fooled* 
               me Jerry!". You see the difference?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TOM
</b>               I'm not gonna say it like that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks 
               back to the yelling guy)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             YELLING GUY
</b>               (with the same bothered face and while 
               he's looking at George) All right everybody, 
               take a five.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (very casual and raising his hand in 
               the air) Yep. That's five!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George? (walks away to talk privately. 
               George, still casual, taps on Jerry's 
               shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience 
               with this acting stuff. But from what 
               I can gather, they're a little touchy 
               about being told how to say the lines.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why is that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know, but they don't seem to 
               like it. By the way how am I doing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking 
               at Tom in the back and then quieter 
               to Jerry) So you think this guy playing 
               Kramer took the raisins?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why would he steal a box of raisins?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look 
               around them suspiciously)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (scene cuts to the bleachers with the producers)

<b>               
</b><b>                             RITA
</b>               (to Jay about Russell) What's with him? 
               (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RITA
</b>               You O.K.?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of 
               something. I'll be back in a second. 
               (he gets up and leaves)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (scene cuts to Jerry sitting next to Sandi. They're both going 
               through their copy of the script)

               it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other 
               dried fruit, just keep it to yourself
