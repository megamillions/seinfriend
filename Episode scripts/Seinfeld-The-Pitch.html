</b><b>                             STU

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             STU
</b>               And basically, I just wanted to let 
               you know that we've been
<b> 
</b>               discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested 
               in
<b> 
</b>               doing something.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Really? Wow.

</b><b>                             STU
</b>               So, if you have any idea for like a 
               TV show for yourself, well,
<b> 
</b>               we'd just love to talk about it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'd be very interested in something

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             STU
</b>               Well, here, uh, why don't you give us 
               a call and maybe we can develop
<b> 
</b>               a series.

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They said they were interested in me.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, a TV show.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Your own show?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I guess so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They want you to do a TV show?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, they want me to come up with an 
               idea. I mean, I don't have
<b> 
</b>               any ideas.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Come on, how hard is that? Look at all 
               the junk that's on TV.
<b> 
</b>               You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in 
               high
<b> 
</b>               school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in 
               gymnastics
<b> 
</b>               and you're pushing him into gymnastics.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Because you're a gymnastics teacher. 
               It's only natural.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But gymnastics is not for everybody.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know, but he's your son.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right, forget that idea, it's not 
               for you....Okay, okay, I
<b> 
</b>               got it. You run an antique store.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah and...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And people come in the store and you 
               get involved in their
<b> 
</b>               lives.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What person who runs an antique store 
               gets involved in people's
<b> 
</b>               lives?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why not?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So someone comes in to buy an old lamp 
               and all of a sudden I'm
<b> 
</b>               getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist 
               because a
<b> 
</b>               pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know, but antiques are very popular 
               right now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No they're not, they used to be.

               And it's funny because my new radar 
               detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. 
               Isn't that strange?

</b>               AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for 
               some reason I didn't hear a thing except 
               for the sound of a police siren.

               You're not artistic and you have no 
               integrity. You know you really need 
               some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't 
               even help you. You need to go to like 
               Vienna or something. You know what I 
               mean? You need to get involved at the 
               University level. Like where Freud studied 
               and have all those people looking at 
               you and checking up on you. That's the 
               kind of help you need. Not the once 
               a week for eighty bucks. No. You need 
               a team. A team of psychiatrists working 
               round the clock thinking about you, 
               having conferences, observing you, like 
               the way they did with the Elephant Man. 
               That's what I'm talking about because 
               that's the only way you're going to 
               get better.

               this. Are you talking about the woman
