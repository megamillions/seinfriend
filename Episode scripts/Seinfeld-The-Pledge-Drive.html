<b>                          THE PLEDGE DRIVE
</b>


                             Written by

                       Tom Gammill & Max Pross




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               There's something very insincere about these greeting cards we 
               send back and
<b> 
</b>               forth to each other all the time. They're like these little one-dollar 
               folded
<b> 
</b>               paper emotional prostitutes, isn't it? "I don't know what my 
               feelings are, so
<b> 
</b>               I'll just pay some total stranger a buck to make up this little 
               Hallmark hooker
<b> 
</b>               to do the job for me. So I can go, 'Yeah, I didn't write this, 
               but whatever
<b> 
</b>               they wrote, I think the same thing.'" Wouldn't it be better if 
               we just had one
<b> 
</b>               card that covered every occasion for everybody in one shot? Just 
               "Happy
<b> 
</b>               birthday, merry Christmas, happy anniversary, congratulations, 
               it's a Boy and
<b> 
</b>               our deepest sympathies. Signed, the whole office"

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry and in Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Your friend, Noreen.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Are you sure you're not just flattering 
               yourself?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If I was flattering myself, I think 
               I'd come up with someone a little
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               less annoying than Noreen.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I cannot believe that she was hitting 
               on you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If you don't believe me, ask her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, 
               Jerry, you know him. Dan.
<b> 
</b>               Remember, we went to that party at his house?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, right. The guy who talks with a 
               really high voice.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer enters.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine 
               in your mail?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Check the pile.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, who sent you a card?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Open it, it's from Hallmark.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hello, my love.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hello, darling.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card 
               from Kristin.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Let me see.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Who's Kristin?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She works for PBS, I met her when I 
               agreed to do that pledge drive.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Did you ask her about me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, in fact she said that you could 
               be one of those people that sits
<b> 
</b>               in the back and answers the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does 
               that work? Now, what, I get a
<b> 
</b>               percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer 
               work. All the money goes
<b> 
</b>               to the station.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, 
               but I still get a tote bag
<b> 
</b>               though, right?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, and one of those foam beer can 
               holders.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer leaves, satisfied.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know what I'm doing? I'm calling 
               Noreen.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, go ahead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You sure you don't mind?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Like she's really going to admit she 
               was flirting with me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine finishes dialing, the phone rings and a high pitched voice 
               answers.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HIGH PITCHED VOICE
