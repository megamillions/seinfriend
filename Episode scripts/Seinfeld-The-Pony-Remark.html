</b>               (Night club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               My parents live in Florida now. They 
               moved there last year. They didn't want 
               to move to Floriday, but they're in 
               their sixties, and that's the law. You 
               know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front 
               of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's 
               go Pop, white belt, white pants, white
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop 
               it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit 
               there, and the conversation's so boring.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, 
               what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would 
               it be like? Just crashed right through the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's 
               all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. 
               No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's 
               pick it up right there."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment)

<b>               
</b>               (Jerry's parents are in town. His father's watching T.V., his 
               mother is ironing his father's jackets)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. 
               I don't know why you had to bring this 
               jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? 
               (He doesn't respond) What's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They 
               sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Phone rings)

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               Are you getting that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I thought you were getting it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               Should I pick up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               You want me to get that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               I'll get it!

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I'll get it!

<b>               
</b>               (They both go for the phone, Helen gets to it first)

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Hello?.. Hello?

<b>               
</b>               (She hangs up. Jerry enters - he's wearing baseball clothes and 
               carrying a bat and glove)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would 
               you make this thing lower! I can hear 
               it on the street! (Turns it off)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               So, how'd you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We won. I made an incredible play in 
               the field! There was a tag-up at third 
               base and I threw the guy out from left 
               field on a fly! We'll be in the championship
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment 
               of my life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               This is your greatest moment? A game?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               You know what my greatest moment was, 
               don't you? 1946. I went to work for 
               Harry Flemming and I came up with the 
               idea for the beltless trench coat.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is 
               this a jacket to wear to an anniversary 
               party?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, the man's an individualist. He 
               worked for Harry Flemming. He knows 
               what he's doing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               But it's their 50th anniversary.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac 
               on the phone today. They invited you 
               again. I think you should go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               So bring her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't even know them. What is she, 
               your second cousin? I mean, I've met 
               them three times in my life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               I don't know her either. (Gesturing 
               to Helen) She makes me fly all the way 
               from Floriday for this, and then she 
               criticizes my jacket.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               At least come and say hello, have a 
               cup of coffee, then you'll leave.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               How come he gets to leave?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, 
               I am leaving. He's always grabbing my 
               arm when he talks to me. I guess it's 
               because so many people have left in 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               middle of his conversation.

</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               And it's always about Jeffrey, right?

</b>               What is the pony? What is the point 
               of the pony? Why do we have these animals, 
               these ponies? What do we do with them? 
               Besides the pony ride. Why
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use 
               them for, you know, crowd control. "Hey, uh, you wanna get back 
               behind the barricades. Hey!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!" 
               So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do 
               you think they could make them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, 
               if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't 
               it? Just have a little pony and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you put him on the, "Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold 
               it. Right ther, Baltic. yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold 
               it right there."
