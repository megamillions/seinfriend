</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               How can I do this?! How can I move back 
               in with those people? Please, tell me! 
               They're insane! You know that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, my parents are just as crazy as 
               your parents.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               How can you compare you parents to my 
               parents?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               My father has never thrown anything 
               out. Ever!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               My father wears his sneakers in the 
               pool! Sneakers!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               My mother has never set foot in a natural 
               body of water.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. 
               My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not 
               a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. 
               never went 'Ha!'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A smirk?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I told you I'd lend you the money for 
               the rent.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from 
               a friend is like having sex. It just 
               completely changes the relationship.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

               know, I still don't understand - why 
               do you want to move back in with your 
               parents?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't want to! I'm outta money! I 
               got 714 dollars left in the bank.
<b> 
</b><b>
