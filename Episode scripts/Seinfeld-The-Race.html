<b>               
</b>               The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. 
               All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then 
               a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side 
               of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door 
               opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas 
               spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning 
               and go, "Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw 
               it anywhere!

               up at one end of the school yard for 
               this big race to see who was going to 
               represent the school in this track meet.

               yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get 
               set, " and I was so keyed up I just 
               took off. By the time he said go I was

</b>               I never did. In four years of high school 
               I would never race anyone again. Not 
               even to the end of the block to catch 
               a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone 
               wanted me to race. They begged me. The 
               track coach called my parents. Pleading. 
               Telling them it was a sin to waste my 
               god given talent. But I answered him 
               in the same way I answered everyone. 
               I chose not to run.

</b>               You know George, it struck me today 
               me that a Communistpipeline into the 
               vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent 
               could be thegreatest thing ever to happen 
               to this organization.

</b><b>               
</b>               there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look 
               at;
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown 
               to Havana right away.

</b>               Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.

</b>               Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring 
               me back some of those cigars in the 
               cedar boxes, you know the ones with 
               the fancy rings? I love those fancy 
               rings. They kind of distract you while 
               you're smoking. The red and yellow are 
               nice. It looks good against the brown 
               of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the 
               Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, 
               that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's 
               good too. That's more of a pale brown, 
               almost like a milky coffee. (George 
               exits) I find the ring size very confusing. 
               They have it in centimeters which I 
               don't really understand that well...

               Presidential palace. There will be girls 
               there and, I hear, some pretty good 
               food. Of course the problem with parties 
               is you invariably have to eat standing 
               up which I don't care for but on the 
               other hand I don't like to balance a 
               plate on my lap either. Once when I 
               was at a party, I put my plate on someone's 
               piano. I assure you, if I had not been 
               a dictator, I would not have been able 
               to get away with that one.
