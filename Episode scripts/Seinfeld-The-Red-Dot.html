</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit 
               of a scary place to work. I don't know 
               how you feel about it. You want to be 
               standing there having people comming 
               in all day going "I need knives. I need 
               more knives. Do you have any bigger 
               knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, 
               long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in 
               the market for. I like them really sharp. 
               Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
               like blades and kind of serrated? That's 
               the kind of knife I'm looking for. I 
               need one I can throw. I need another 
               one I can just hack away with. Do you 
               have anything like that?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well what do you think? They put the 
               statue on a giant raft and a tugboat 
               pulled it all the way from France?

               in pieces and screwed it together like 
               a coffee table?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So countries just exchange gifts like

               you're a little nervous. Well throw 
               back a couple shots of Hennigans and 
               you'll be as loose as a goose and ready 
               to roll in no time. And because it's 
               odorless, why, it will be our little

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You had sex with the cleaning woman

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               office and the cleaning woman comes 
               in. I've always been attracted to cleaning 
               women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know but I couldn't think of anything

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you started drinking.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So we started drinking, and I'll tell 
               you I don't know if it was the alcohol 
               or the ammonia, but the next think I 
               knew she was mopping the floor with 
               me.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well the sex was okay, but I threw up 
               from the Hennigans.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Come on up.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, let me ask you something something. 
               Did George buy that sweater knowing 
               the red dot was on it because it was 
               cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, 
               you just gave me the answer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No I didn't.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your 
               expression.
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I didn't have an expression. I have 
               a deviated septum. I have to open my 
               mouth sometimes to breathe.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Frankly I am shocked that you would 
               ask such a question (Elaine sticking 
               out her tongue like she isn't buying 
               a word of it) of me, that you would 
               think - the only surprise is how you 
               could even think of that. That's what 
               you were seeing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing 
               lady is turning the screws on me. She's 
               pushing for this whole relationship 
               thing. She keeps calling me, threatening 
               to go to the boss with this thing, I 
               could lose my job, I gotta do something 
               to keep her quiet.

               I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots 
               everywhere. I thought everything in 
               the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
               distinguish one red dot from another. 
               I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. 
               I haven't worked for a really long time. 
               (Jerry is standing right behind George. 
               Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts 
               fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have 
               no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. 
               It's just a little red dot.

</b>               When I was a little girl in Panama, 
               a rich American came to our town and 
               he was wearing the softest most beautiful 
               sweater. I said to him, "what do you 
               call this most beautiful fabric?", and 
               he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated 
               the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked 
               if I could have it, and he said "No. 
               Get away from me." Then he started walk 
               away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming 
               for him to give me the sweater and he 
               dragged me through the street. And then 
               he kicked at me with the other foot 
               and threw some change at me. Oh, but 
               I didn't want the change Georgie. I 
               wanted the cashmere.

</b>               Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks 
               down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, 
               his hand shaking.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Of course it's cashmere.

</b><b>                             DICK
</b>               (noticing the dot) What's this?

<b>               
</b>               At the comedy club.

</b>               But in a way, I think I inadvertantly 
               turned this guy into an alcoholic. I 
               hate being around alcoholics because 
               they're either telling you how much 
               they love you or how much they hate 
               you. And those are the two statements 
               that scare me the most. But I think 
               he's okay now because I have no idea 
               how he feels about me. He's finally 
               off the wagon.
