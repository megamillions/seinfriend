               It's over. I'm gone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing 
               at
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               object over on desk) I quit!

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Boy, I have really had it with Newman. 
               He wakes me up again last
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up 
               onto the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               roof to kill himself.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, what'd you say?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening 
               to do this for years. I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and 
               stop
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing 
               something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's his problem?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No job. No women.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He called the right guy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               What am I supposed to tell him? How 
               much there is for him to live
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for? Why should I lie to him?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All right, I'm leaving. I going to the 
               laundry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Why don't you use the machines down 
               in the basement?
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Fluff and fold. The only way to live. 
               (snapping fingers in tune with
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't wanna mix in everything! My

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll 
               start a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               riot.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. I can't say as I have.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Whatever it costs. In fact, I would

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               not even touching each other. Because something could, you know,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in real estate?

</b>               Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I like sports. I could do something 
               in sports.
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know, like the general manager of 
               a baseball team or something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it doesn't even have to be the 
               general manager. Maybe I could
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always 
               make
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               those interesting comments during the game.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, they tend to give those jobs to 
               ex-ballplayers and people that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               are, you know, in broadcasting.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, that's really not fair.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Movies. I like to watch movies.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Do they pay people to watch movies?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Projectionists.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's true.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But you gotta know how to work the projector.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And it's probably a union thing.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. 
               Sports,...movies. What about a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               talk show host?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Talk show host. That's good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think I'd be good at that. I talk 
               to people all the time. Someone
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get 
               that, though. Where do you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               start?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, that's where it gets tricky.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You can't just walk into a building 
               and say " I wanna be a talk
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               show host."

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I wouldn't think so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's all politics.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk 
               show host. What else?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This could have been a huge mistake.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, it doesn't sound like you completely 
               thought this through.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (sighs) What should I do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe you can just go back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Go back?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.

               on Monday morning like it
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sure. You're an emotional person. People 
               don't take you seriously.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Never happened.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I was just blowin' off a little steam.

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Never happened.
