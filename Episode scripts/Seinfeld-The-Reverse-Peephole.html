</b><b>                             WAITRESS

</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Thank you. Ow!

<b>               
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               I just told you it was hot. Why'd you

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I just wanted to know what your idea

<b>

</b>               Puddy entering Monk's in a fur coat

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine cracking up when she sees Puddy's coat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why 
               are you wearing that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               It's my winter coat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               A fur?

<b>               
</b>               Puddy sits down in the booth.

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Is there a problem?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               A seemingly infinite supply.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine touching the plate again.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ow! Careful, it's hot.

<b>               
</b>               Puddy touching the plate.

<b>               
</b><b>                             PUDDY
</b>               Ow!

<b>               
</b>               Jerry, in his apartment with Elaine and George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, Puddy wear's a man fur?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He was struttin' around the coffee shop 
               like Stein Erickson.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And, of course, you find fur morally 
               reprehensible.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy 
               anymore? This is more about hanging 
               off the arm of an idiot.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And this is the first you're seeing 
               of the coat?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We never dated in winter.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You might want to get a look at that 
               bathing suit drawer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other 
               day, and I saw that massage chair we 
               want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment 
               gift.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               An apartment-warming gift? We got to 
               give presents to people for moving? 
               Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. 
               I would like one month off.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's 
               what we're gettin' him.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right, but we're not buyin' it at 
               Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay 
               me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. 
               I have a sixth sense.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Cheapness is not a sense.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You 
               know, the second you walk in, he's got 
               you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do 
               me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I had a great time at the last one. 
               I was in charge of the music. I turned 
               that mother out.

</b>               Kramer enters Jerry's apartment with Newman.

<b>

</b>               What, has Newman got another army man

</b><b>                             NEWMAN

</b>               Newman and I are reversing the peepholes 
               on our door. So you can see in.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why?

</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               To prevent an ambush.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone 
               is waiting to jack me with a sock full 
               of pennies.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But then anyone can just look in and 
               see you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Our policy is, we're comfortable with 
               our bodies. You know, if someone wants 
               to help themselves to an eyefull, well, 
               we say, 'Enjoy the show.'

</b>               Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.

<b>               
</b>               Silvio with his wife, Kramer, and Newman in Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I, uh, I like to think of this 
               as my conference room. Yeah, it has 
               a more formal atmosphere, you know, 
               with the shelves, and the furniture.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SILVIO
</b>               Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I 
               are about to go bowling.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, 
               uh, evicted him?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SILVIO
</b>               I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is 
               an agitator.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Look... I've known Newman all my life, 
               in the building, and you're all wrong 
               about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, 
               yes, but smart as a whip.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SILVIO
</b>               OK, on your word he can stay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               All right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SILVIO
</b>               But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, you won't regret it.

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer looks up at Newman and he sees him close to kissing Silvio's 
               wife. Silvio, sees the cigar fall right out of Kramer's mouth.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SILVIO

<b>               
</b>               (Kramer hurriedly picks the cigar up, but puts the wrong end 
               in his mouth, burning his tongue, and quickly replacing it the 
               right way in his mouth)

</b><b>                             JOE MAYO
</b>               Hey, I got a coat just like this!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. Uhhh...

<b>               
</b>               Elaine at Monk's with George and Jerry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And you threw it out the window?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Mm-hmm.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               God, you're like a rock star.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him 
               a new coat.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because you threw it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, because I was in charge of the coats. 
               It's... insane.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But you did actually throw his coat 
               out the window.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               But he doesn't know that. As far as 
               he knows, somebody stole it, and that's 
               the person who should be responsible.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So I guess I'll have to buy him a new 
               coat, even though I don't think I should 
               be held responsible, which I am anyway.

</b>               George, taking out his wallet to pay the check.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you 
               got a filing cabinet under half of your 
               ass.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George replacing his wallet in his pocket.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This...is an organizer, a secretary,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Look at you. You're on a slant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (He pulls some napkins out of the dispenser, puts them in his 
               other back pocket, and becomes un-slanted)
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               There, there I'm fine.

<b>               
</b>               (Suddenly, half of George's body falls with a crunch sound, as 
               he becomes slanty the other way now)

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think I had some hard candy in there.

<b>
