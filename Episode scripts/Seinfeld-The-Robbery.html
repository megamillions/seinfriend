</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So I move into the centre lane, now 
               I get ahead of this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               the finger. It seems like such an... arbitrary, ridiculous

<b>               
</b>               thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person.

<b>               
</b>               (shows several fingers to the audience) It's a finger, what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? 
<b>               I
</b><b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               finger. 'Cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               uh (pretends to drive with one foot in the air and speaks to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               person driving next to him) look at that toe, buddy. (puts his
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               foot down) I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe,

<b>               
</b>               isn't it ?

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is packing. Elaine is sitting

<b>               
</b>               at the table watching Jerry)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the 
               mini-umbrella,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               something boring to read on the plane. (zips his bag with

<b>               
</b>               exaggerated motions) That's it. Done!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (claps her hands) That is the single 
               greatest packing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               performance I have ever seen.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (proudly) I am...the master packer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (laughs) Yeah, right, you're the master 
               packer.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What you must understand, Elaine, (picks 
               up the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into

<b>               
</b><b>                             BATTLE
</b>               you've gotta know the strengths and 
               weaknesses (hits
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               his bag rhythmically with his umbrella) of every soldier in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of

<b>               
</b>               ordinary black socks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               'Scuse me...master packer!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               ...Yes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Just gimme your keys.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright, sir. (tosses Elaine his keys; 
               apartment buzzer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               goes of, Jerry speaks over the intercom) George?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (outside over the intercom) Yeah

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (Jerry opens the door) OK, so, now, 
               is there anything
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               else I need to know 'bout this place?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes 
               a little while to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all

<b>               
</b>               your shopping, you...come back and take a shower.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               OK, this is quite a place.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There's more, the refrigerator. (Opens 
               it) Deduct a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               minimum of two days of all expiration dates. (uses the

<b>               
</b>               umbrella to point to certain compartments in the refrigerator)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (closes the refrigerator)
