               Maybe he'll write a song about me. That 
               would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are 
               so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not 
               so mention your personality which is 
               so, so, interesting. If you want, you 
               can quit your job and never work again.

</b>               Jerry, you have got to come see him. 
               He is so terrific.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, he's a musician. I guess they're 
               supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited 
               and free.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, you really did me in this time, 
               didn't ya? First guy I like in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is 
               just
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and 
               then
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He wrote a song about it!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, maybe it's a good thing.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad 
               thing! Do you know what this is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel 
               sick
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?

               say it, doesn't sound very
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pleasant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, one of these days, something 
               terrible is gonna happen to you.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far 
               as your situation, you're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can't! He's got a big showcase for
