               seems to be that strap, that connects 
               in the back so you can take 'em on and 
               off. Which I don't get, because I thought, 
               if you have glasses, isn't that because 
               you need to wear glasses? 'You need 
               glasses', isn't that what they say? 
               I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would 
               you care for some glasses?' When people 
               have crutches, they don't havelike a 
               little chain attached to their belt, 
               so they can just let go of 'em every 
               now and then. Why not get a toupee with 
               a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, 
               the thing could just... (mimes semi-airborne

</b>               (Different Street)

<b>               
</b>               A cop, with an eye patch, is writing a ticket for a car. Kramer 
               is about to cross
<b> 
</b>               the street. He waits for a car to pass. As it passes, a tray 
               of litter is tossed
<b> 
</b>               from its window and lands near Kramer.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to car as it accelerates away) Hey

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The cop hears this and turns to see who said it. As he does so, 
               the car he is
<b> 
</b>               ticketing starts up and speeds away.

<b>               
</b><b>                             COP
</b>               (at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes advantage of the distraction to run away.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean 
               this is my town. You don't throw
<b> 
</b>               trash on the streets of my town.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Didn't you explain that to the cop?

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               George enters. He looks disquieted.

<b> 
</b><b>

               the door slowly
<b> 
</b>               and can be seen peering in through the decreasing gap until it 
               finally shuts
<b> 
</b>               completely. Jerry and George watch him until the door is closed.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I

</b>               I have to say, as a glasses wearer I

</b><b>                             COP
</b>               Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. 
               In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed 
               a
<b> 
</b>               brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine 
               was never paid, and
<b> 
</b>               since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than 
               anyone in New
<b> 
</b>               York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give 
               me the slip
<b> 
</b>               time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but 
               he's become my
<b> 
</b>               'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks 
               to you, I don't
<b> 
</b>               know if I'll ever get that chance again!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I like that eye patch.

<b> 
</b><b>

               steps over Jerry's legs) You know,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               he has to be the only one who has 'em.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b>               Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? (she slams the door shut before

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can't believe you did that! Why did 
               you tell him I said hi? I never
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I never heard her say hi.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, it's uh, common courtesy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't 
               understand. He made the last
<b> 
</b>               contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup 
               relationship. If he
<b> 
</b>               thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you

</b>               Jake Jarmel is at the same table as before. Elaine is talking

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So you see, Kramer took it upon himself

</b>               in fact it was an unauthorised hi.

</b><b>                             JAKE

<b>

<b>

               'go ahead'

<b>               
</b>               Typical number of customers. George enters, wearing his new toupee. 
               One or two
<b> 
</b>               of the staff give him a glance. He looks around, and taps the 
               counter by the
<b> 
</b>               cash register. A beautiful brunette sitting at the nearest table 
               give him an
<b> 
</b>               admiring look.

<b>

</b><b>                             WOMAN

<b>               
</b>               She pushes the chair opposite her out from the table in an invitation 
               for George
<b> 
</b>               to sit down. George looks pleasantly surprised by the beneficial 
               effects of his
<b> 
</b>               hairpiece.

<b>               
</b>               (Press conference)

<b>               
</b>               Mr Lippman and Jake Jarmel are on a small stage with a lectern. 
               In front of it
<b> 
</b>               are a group of reporters and, amongst them sits Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             LIPPMAN
</b>               (at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and 
               gentlemen of the press, it is my
<b> 
</b>               pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake 
               as he vacates the
<b> 
</b>               lectern in his favour)

<b>               
</b>               There is a brief ripple of applause as Jake steps up to take 
               questions.
<b>

</b><b>                             REPORTER
</b>               So Jake, what's your percentage on this 
               book?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Several of the reporters laugh, as does Jake. Mr Lippman steps 
               back to the
<b> 
</b>               lectern. He has some notes, and is extracting his glasses from 
               his pocket.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             LIPPMAN

               interesting information on that.

</b>               (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             LIPPMAN

</b><b>                             JAKE
</b>               Those glasses, where did you get those

</b><b>                             LIPPMAN

<b>               
</b><b>                             JAKE
</b>               (to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some 
               kind of a joke on me? Because it's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) 
               I want the
<b> 
</b>               glasses! Give me those!

<b>               
</b>               He tries to pull them from Lippman's face, and a struggle ensues. 
               Jake can be
<b> 
</b>               heard demanding the glasses. The reporters endeavour to get a 
               view of the noisy
<b> 
</b>               fracas. Elaine rises and begins to make her way toward the exit. 
               She is
<b> 
</b>               apologetic to her neighbour.
