</b>               I got no leg room back here. Move your

</b>               There's a mechanism. You just pull it,

</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               I pulled it. It doesn't go.

</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               If you want the leg room, say you want 
               the leg room! Don't blame
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the mechanism!

</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               Like an animal. Because of her, I have 
               to sit here like an animal!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Serenity now! Serenity now!

</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. 
               When my blood pressure gets
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'

</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               The man on the tape wasn't specific.

</b><b>                             ESTELLE
</b>               I told you to fix that thing.

</b>               American cousin, the Sasquatch.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>
