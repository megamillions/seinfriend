<b>                             THE SEVEN

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry's standup piece.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I love it when people are complimented 
               on something they're wearing and they 
               accept the compliment as if it was about 
               them. "Nice tie." "Well, thank you. 
               Thank you very much." The compliment 
               is for the tie, it's not for you, but 
               we take it. That's kind of the job of 
               clothes; to get compliments for us, 
               because it's very hard to get compliments 
               based on your human qualities. Right? 
               Let's face it, no matter how nice a 
               person you are, nobody's gonna come 
               say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier 
               to be a bastard and just try and match 
               the colours up.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Antique Toy Store)

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, 
               puppets, etc.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (awed) Oh, look at this!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, I miss the days they made toys 
               that could kill a kid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye.

               It's an old-fashioned girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a 
               pink frame and a basket on the front.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing 
               a dress of
<b> 
</b>               mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and 
               white on the chest
<b> 
</b>               and arms.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right 
               there with ya.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! 
               And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always 
               wanted one of these when I was little.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the 
               store,
<b> 
</b>               and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she 
               goes, she notices
<b> 
</b>               and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious 
               to Elaine's
<b> 
</b>               voice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (tearing himself away from Christie) 
               Huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What d'you think?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHRISTIE
</b>               I think your friend needs some help 
               over there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, the only way to really help 
               her is to just let her be.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the 
               bike off
<b> 
</b>               the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves 
               too much and she
<b> 
</b>               falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the 
               bike pinning her
<b> 
</b>               down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, 
               so she rings
<b> 
</b>               the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away 
               from Christie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey!

<b>               
</b>               Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.

<b>               
</b><b>

</b>               (Restaurant)

<b>               
</b>               George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie 
               is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, 
               right? So what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               does that make me?

</b><b>                             CARRIE
</b>               Doesn't make you anything.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could 
               marry your daughter.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. 
               Ken and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Carrie look perturbed.

</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is 
               building
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles 
               sliced
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated 
               by the way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh 
               boy. Mmm, that's good.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're really going to town with that 
               turkey there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's on the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (examining a yellow squeeze bottle)

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ah, 's no good.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread 
               on,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits 
               out the mouthful he's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next 
               to it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No. That's bush league.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer heads toward the door.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're 
               gonna leave it there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               That's like half a pound of turkey!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, I can't eat that. You can't 
               eat a sandwich without
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Dijon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really 
               should keep more of your
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               favourites on hand.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. 
               What, are you unhappy
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with our arrangement?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What arrangement?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I was under the impression that 
               I could take anything I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want 
               from mine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when 
               you get something in there
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and I will.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and 
               she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh, hey.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it...

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               God. Man, this is killing me. Right 
               now, I would give that bike
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the first person who could make this pain go away.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Aw, you really hurting, huh?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for 
               her neck.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Alright, lean forward, relax.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise 
               man once taught me the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah hah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (seriously worried) Wha...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               He's a genius. Here we go...

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine 
               looks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the 
               arm of the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               From pain, will come pleasure.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a 
               loud
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go 
               of her head and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               steps away, job done.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh? Voila.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer heads for the door.

</b>               George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is

</b>               Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just 
               told him
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               about his contretemps with Susan.

</b>               Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. 
               Seven. Seven periods of

</b>               school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, 
               and eventually
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

</b><b>               
</b>               Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or 
               uh, Ketchup?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Pretty name for a girl.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               array of good within.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry. I had this name for a long time.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Christie? That's the one you met in

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, she had this great black and white 
               dress, with a scoop
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And you met her in an antique store!

<b>               
</b>               George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small

</b><b>               
</b>               goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>               
</b>               want.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One 
               cupcake." And then I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and 
               drops it into the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bowl) There. Very simple.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sort of a mooching inventory.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>

</b>               Kramer, I don't know if you're getting

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>

</b>               hears the hiss, and notices George.

</b>               Well this is it. The food is atrocious,

<b>               
</b>               Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single

</b>               I love it when people are complimented 
               on something they're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. 
               "Nice tie." "Well,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, 
               it's not for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get 
               compliments for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and 
               just try and

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, 
               puppets, etc.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (awed) Oh, look at this!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, I miss the days they made toys 
               that could kill a kid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket 
               on the front.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing 
               a dress of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and 
               white on the chest
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and arms.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right 
               there with ya.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! 
               And it's the girl's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.

<b>               
</b>               Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the 
               store,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she 
               goes, she notices
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious 
               to Elaine's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               voice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (tearing himself away from Christie) 
               Huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What d'you think?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHRISTIE
</b>               I think your friend needs some help 
               over there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, the only way to really help 
               her is to just let her be.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the 
               bike off
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves 
               too much and she
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the 
               bike pinning her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, 
               so she rings
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away 
               from Christie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey!

<b>               
</b>               Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.

</b>               (Restaurant)

<b>               
</b>               George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie 
               is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.
<b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             KEN
</b>               Doctor says it could be any day now.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, 
               you and Susan are
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, 
               right? So what
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               does that make me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             CARRIE
</b>               Doesn't make you anything.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could 
               marry your daughter.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. 
               Ken and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Carrie look perturbed.

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               So, have you picked out a name yet?

</b><b>                             CARRIE

               We like Kimberley.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             CARRIE
</b>               We'll put it on the list.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I solve problems. That's just what I

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry's Apartment)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is 
               building
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles 
               sliced
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated 
               by the way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh 
               boy. Mmm, that's good.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're really going to town with that 
               turkey there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's on the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (examining a yellow squeeze bottle) 
               What, this yellow stuff?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ah, 's no good.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread 
               on,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits 
               out the mouthful he's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next 
               to it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No. That's bush league.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer heads toward the door.

<b>

               gonna leave it there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               That's like half a pound of turkey!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, I can't eat that. You can't 
               eat a sandwich without
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Dijon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               favourites on hand.

               What, are you unhappy
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               with our arrangement?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I was under the impression that 
               I could take anything I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want 
               from mine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

               you get something in there
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and I will.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and 
               she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Still killing me from having to get 
               that bike off the wall.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (pointedly) By myself.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, if it's any consolation, I did 
               get her number.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you 
               pulled it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               it...

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hell up?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               God. Man, this is killing me. Right 
               now, I would give that bike
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the first person who could make this pain go away.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for 
               her neck.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Alright, lean forward, relax.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (worried) What? What?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what 
               you're doing here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise 
               man once taught me the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah hah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (seriously worried) Wha...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               He's a genius. Here we go...

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine 
               looks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the 
               arm of the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               From pain, will come pleasure.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a 
               loud
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go 
               of her head and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               steps away, job done.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh? Voila.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain 
               is totally gone!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's even more amazing is his formal 
               training is in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               paediatrics.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Awright, my work is done here.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer heads for the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (closing the door) Yeah, you can send 
               that bike over any time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, 
               what is he talking about?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said 
               you'd give the bike to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               anyone who fixes your neck.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You really think he wants the bike?

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It took him like ten seconds!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, that's the most he's worked in 
               the last four months.

<b>               
</b>               George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is 
               happy,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               smiling and whistling.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think they really went for that Soda.

</b>               Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               I can tell you, I would never name my

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Susan scoffs.

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               It's not a name. It's a number.

</b>               Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just 
               told him
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               about his contretemps with Susan.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. 
               Seven. Seven periods of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, 
               and eventually
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

               up with a better name
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               than Seven.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over

</b>               array of good within.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Christie? That's the one you met in

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, she had this great black and white 
               dress, with a scoop
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And you met her in an antique store!

</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (putting the items on the counter) Got

</b><b>               
</b>               Refrigerator problem, is solved.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever 
               you want.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

               Alright, I take what I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               want.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One 
               cupcake." And then I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and 
               drops it into the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               bowl) There. Very simple.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sort of a mooching inventory.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>

</b>               Kramer, I don't know if you're getting

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. 
               Kramer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hears the hiss, and notices George.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long

</b>               Well this is it. The food is atrocious,

</b><b>                             CHRISTIE
</b>               Yes, thank you.

<b>               
</b>               The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing 
               that

</b>               she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique 
               store. Jerry
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks

</b>               Fingers his chin thoughtfully.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit

</b><b>               
</b>               compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer

</b>               Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from 
               Kramer. He was hard up for

</b><b>               
</b>               cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, 
               I had to make
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               some minor modifications, you know. Solid tyres, reinforced seatpost, 
               heavy duty

</b><b>               
</b>               shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

</b>               I love it when people are complimented 
               on something they're
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. 
               "Nice tie." "Well,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, 
               it's not for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get 
               compliments for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person 
               you are, nobody's gonna come
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and 
               just try and
<b>

</b>               match the colours up.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats,

</b>               Boy, I miss the days they made toys 
               that could kill a kid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket 
               on the front.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing 
               a dress of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and 
               white on the chest
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and arms.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right 
               there with ya.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! 
               And it's the girl's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.

<b>               
</b>               Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the 
               store,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she 
               goes, she notices
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious 
               to Elaine's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               voice.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.

</b>               You know, the only way to really help 
               her is to just let her be.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the 
               bike off
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves 
               too much and she
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the 
               bike pinning her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, 
               so she rings
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away 
               from Christie.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is 
               building
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles 
               sliced
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated 
               by the way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.

</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ah, 's no good.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread 
               on,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits 
               out the mouthful he's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next 
               to it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no, I can't eat that. You can't 
               eat a sandwich without

</b><b>               
</b>               Dijon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I was under the impression that 
               I could take anything I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want 
               from mine.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and 
               she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               to the first person who could make this pain go away.

<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for 
               her neck.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah hah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               He's a genius. Here we go...

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine 
               looks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the 
               arm of the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               From pain, will come pleasure.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a 
               loud
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go 
               of her head and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               steps away, job done.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh? Voila.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

</b>               Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just 
               told him
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               about his contretemps with Susan.

</b>               Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. 
               Seven. Seven periods of

</b>               school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, 
               and eventually
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over

</b>               array of good within.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b>               Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Christie? That's the one you met in

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, she had this great black and white 
               dress, with a scoop
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And you met her in an antique store!

<b>               
</b>               George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small

</b><b>               
</b>               goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

</b>               Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever

</b>               want.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One 
               cupcake." And then I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and 
               drops it into the

</b><b>               
</b>               bowl) There. Very simple.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sort of a mooching inventory.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               stumbling way upright again.

               Someone whose
<b>

</b><b>               
</b>               rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I

<b>               
</b>               Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single

<b>               
</b>               Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, 
               puppets, etc.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (awed) Oh, look at this!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, I miss the days they made toys 
               that could kill a kid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket 
               on the front.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!

<b>               
</b>               Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing 
               a dress of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and 
               white on the chest
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and arms.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right 
               there with ya.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! 
               And it's the girl's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.

<b>               
</b>               Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the 
               store,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she 
               goes, she notices
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious 
               to Elaine's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               voice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (tearing himself away from Christie) 
               Huh?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHRISTIE
</b>               I think your friend needs some help 
               over there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, the only way to really help 
               her is to just let her be.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the 
               bike off
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves 
               too much and she
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the 
               bike pinning her
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, 
               so she rings
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away 
               from Christie.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.

<b>               
</b>               George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie

</b><b>               
</b>               Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, 
               right? So what

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could 
               marry your daughter.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. 
               Ken and

</b>               Carrie look perturbed.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is 
               building
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles 
               sliced
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated 
               by the way
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's on the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (examining a yellow squeeze bottle)

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Ah, 's no good.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread 
               on,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits 
               out the mouthful he's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next 
               to it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No. That's bush league.

<b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and 
               she's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               He's a genius. Here we go...

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine 
               looks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the 
               arm of the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               From pain, will come pleasure.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a 
               loud
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go 
               of her head and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               steps away, job done.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh? Voila.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

</b>               Kramer heads for the door.

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>

</b>               Jerry. I had this name for a long time.

</b>               Yeah, she had this great black and white 
               dress, with a scoop
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b>               George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small

</b>               want.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

</b>               Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One

</b>               put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end

</b>               Kramer, I don't know if you're getting

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. 
               Kramer

</b>               hears the hiss, and notices George.

</b>               Well this is it. The food is atrocious,

</b>               Yes, thank you.

<b>               
</b>               The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing 
               that

</b>               she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks

<b>               
</b>               Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single

</b><b>               
</b>               compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer

</b>               Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up

<b>

</b>               Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer.

</b>               Kramer takes a look.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>

</b>               Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's

<b>               
</b>               Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey, that's my bike!

<b>               
</b>               Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the 
               Schwinn
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for all he's worth. He rings the bell.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Gangway!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               This is my bike!

<b>               
</b>               Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from 
               Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty 
               bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? 
               Of course, I had to make some minor 
               modifications, you know. Solid tires, 
               reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. 
               But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Newman begins to ride away.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (chasing Newman) No, you better gimme 
               back that bike. Newman, gimme...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

<b>               
</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Hey!! Help me!

<b>               
</b>               The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and 
               a determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a 
               struggle.
