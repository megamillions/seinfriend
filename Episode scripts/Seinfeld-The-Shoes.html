<b>                             THE SHOES

                             Written by

                     Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment, working on the script 
               for the "Jerry" pilot episode.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wait a second, wait a second...and then 
               the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it 
               up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick 
               of cleaning." That's very funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've never seen a pilot script as funny 
               as this!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, it's funny!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I mean, how funny is this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I mean, we're not stupid, right? We 
               know when something's funny!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It cannot not be funny! Now come on, 
               let's stay with it, we gotta finish 
               this today.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should 
               give it to my therapist to read. She's 
               smart, I trust her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hey, you know, we haven't brought the 
               Elaine character into the show yet. 
               We should try and get her into this 
               scene.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine 
               enters. (Thinks) What does she say...?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know, what do women say?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't even know what they think. That's 
               why I'm in therapy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's 
               going to be so many people to keep track 
               of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget 
               where everybody's standing, you, me, 
               Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright. (They tear the pages out of 
               their notepads. Kramer enters.)

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You are never gonna believe who I just 
               ran into today.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Did you talk to her?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I was on my way to the Y, and 
               I saw her coming towards me? I didn't 
               know what to do! Because I remembered 
               you had three dates with her and she 
               wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now 
               I'm thinking, what is my duty to my 
               friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore 
               her? I mean, what is my responsibility 
               here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, 
               (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You 
               know? Like nothing happened! Like she 
               never went three dates with you and 
               refused to kiss you goodnight.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I know about the three dates.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know what I did? I snubbed her.

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I walked right by her - bffffft - never 
               said a word.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What you do say about a guy like this, 
               huh! (George applauds.) You are some 
               great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! 
               (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've 
               never condoned snubbing in my administration. 
               Your loyalty is beyond question.

               I was in a good mood - coulda been a

               know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we 
               couldn't write for a woman. We didn't 
               know what you would say. Even right 
               now, I'm sitting here, I know you're 
               going to say something, I have no idea

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Well, George, I think you're beginning 
               to get some perspective on things. I 
               think we're making progress.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, I feel like I've grown.

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Good. So, let's pick up on this next 
               week.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the 
               way, did you get a chance to read the 
               script?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Yes, yes I did.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, what'd you think?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Uh...it was...good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You didn't like it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Well, no, I -

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't believe this! What was wrong 
               with it? What didn't you like about 
               it?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               It wasn't funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               No, I didn't find it funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You didn't find it funny?! This is what 
               I'm paying for?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               Well, that whole storyline about a guy 
               who gets into a car accident, doesn't 
               have any insurance, so the judge sentences 
               him to be a butler? I didn't really 
               buy that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we 
               pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, 
               the president of NBC, and he ate it 
               up with a spoon.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               George, if you're going to be in a creative 
               field, you're going to have to learn 
               how to deal with criticism.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. 
               How do like that criticism? You know 
               what's funny to me? That diploma up 
               on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! 
               You sitting here, telling people what 
               to do.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DANA
</b>               I think you'd better go.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads 
               for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's 
               fault. He took out all my good lines. 
               He's such a control freak!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both 
               standing by the door. Elaine enters.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So, you send me to this therapist to 
               help me with my emotional disorders, 
               and she criticizes our script. (Tosses 
               the script to Jerry.) What kind of a 
               therapist is that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I guess she didn't think it was funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What 
               is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed 
               to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely 
               shattered my confidence. And I'm paying 
               for this, she's my employee!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought your mother's paying for it.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And she slaves to earn every penny. 
               So that someday, I might be able to 
               walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm 
               bald, but I'm still a good person."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, he's right. It's not her place 
               to criticize the script, which reminds 
               me - what did you think of it? You never 
               told me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What did I think of it? (Manufactures 
               a cough instead of answering. Kramer 
               enters.)
<b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               because I snubbed her, and then we started 
               talking a little bit, and I walked her 
               to her building. And just before I left, 
               I put my arm around her waist, I pulled 
               her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one!

               snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman

               George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage 
               as she bends over and looks in her backpack. 
               Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, 
               hypnotized. Russell comes up behind 
               George.)

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               You're supposed to just take a peek 
               after a poke. You were like you just

               metal things on top of the Empire State 
               Building.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. 
               What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? 
               This is all I have in my life.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Looking at cleavage is like looking 
               at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's 
               too risky. You get a sense of it and 
               then you look away.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage 
               peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look 
               at his daughter's cleavage? She's got 
               nice cleavage.

</b>               That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the 
               door to take some trash out, and meets 
               Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)

               I think she might have sneezed all over 
               someone's pasta primavera. Someone might 
               have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If you hadn't gone into her restaurant,

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Look, I don't like people talking about

               are my business. The two of you shouldn't

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There was cleavage in the area. That's 
               a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with 
               an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You don't consider age in the face of 
               cleavage. This occurs on a molecular 
               level, you can't control it! We're like 
               some kind of weird fish where the eyes 
               operate independently of the head.

               have Gail call us, tell us the next 
               time he's there, go there and talk to 
               him.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The whole thing is so stupid. Like he 
               wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail

               Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask

               'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation,

</b>               You know, it's a funny thing, because 
               after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't 
               heard from you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Didn't hear anything...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Didn't know...we were wondering...what 
               happened.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               It just didn't seem to be the right 
               project for us right now. (Elaine walks 
               by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George 
               look at her as she moves to the table 
               opposite Russell.) So, what were you 
               saying?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh...uh, because if it had anything 
               at all to do with what you perceived 
               as me leering at your daughter, I really 
               have to take issue with that. I did 
               not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's 
               table.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and 
               goes back to her table.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, 
               and something enters my field of vision, 
               that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine 
               loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin 
               at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Under the circumstances, I don't really 
               feel that we should be in business together. 
               (Elaine comes back over.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Here's your ketchup back. You know, 
               I had the hardest time trying to get 
               some out. I mean, I just kept pounding 
               and pounding on the bottom of it. Do 
               you have any trouble?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Do you have a...ketchup secret?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't 
               have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Because if you do have a ketchup secret, 
               I would really, really like to know 
               what it is. (Russell is pleased, and 
               smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to 
               her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RUSSELL
</b>               Field of vision, huh?

<b>               
</b>               New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. 
               Gail comes over to the table.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GAIL

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Mmmm.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Really good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This pasta primavera is fabulous.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Very tasty.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GAIL
</b>               How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Great.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's 
               going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail 
               nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, 
               if Russell mentions anything about the 
               pilot, you'll of course tell him how 
               much you liked it...?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, I happen to have the script 
               right here with me and, uh...on page 
               3, for example, suppose the Elaine character 
               comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. 
               And the butler is very distracted, and 
               can't work.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little 
               broad for us.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's 
               alley.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it's a funny idea.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's funny!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               C'mon, funny is funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, 
               right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell 
               tomorrow night.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If you can.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the 
               way?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts 
               choking on his wine, and attempts to 
               tell Elaine something.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think what he's trying to say is, 
               "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 
               'yes' and continues to choke.)
<b>
