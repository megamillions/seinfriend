</b>               Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a 
               physical because as you may or may not 
               know, he and I are going on a trip to 
               Kenya. Africa. My first such mission 
               for the company. The Massai bushmen 
               wear these great sandals and we're gonna 
               knock them off. Not the Massai, the 
               sandals.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know how hot it gets there? Like

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, they were humiliated. I mean after

</b>               left office in disgrace.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, 
               Lydia. In fact, he moved
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in with her.

</b><b>                             JERRY

               a Mongolian
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of 
               the clothing
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked 
               about. "Just a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               taste," he said. That was all it took.

</b>               Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going 
               on here. I am not addicted to

               Frank and Estelle, he's obviously disappointed.

</b>               Kramer, in the shower, he's got the Commando 450 shower head 
               hooked up. He 
               turns it on, the water shoots out full blast and knocks him backwards. 
               He grabs 
               the shower curtain for support and tries to reach forward to 
               turn the faucet 
               off, but the force of the water is too great, he only succeeds 
               in knocking over 
               a few shampoo bottles. Kramer is eventually pushed back enough 
               by the water to 
               become entangled in the shower curtain until he eventually falls 
               out of the 
               shower, and out of camera range.
