</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               Your background is impressive George,

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               smoothing things over, you know, chiseling 
               away, grinding down. In fact we used 
               to call it 'the grind'.
<b>

</b><b>                             KRUGER

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This 
               family sits up next to me. I go in to 
               the surfs and when I come from out, 
               my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're 
               all gone. I am furious, I start screaming 
               to these kids demanding my stuff back 
               and finally I lose it; I grab their 
               boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Then I see my clothes floating out there. 
               The tied took them out, not the kids.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So now, the father is screaming at me, 
               he's demanding that I pay for the boom 
               box. Finally, I gave them a fake address 
               and got the hell out of there.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE
