</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, I was sitting at the reception desk, 
               I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing 
               my sling back pumps.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What are those?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ask your mother, you live with her now, 
               don't you? Anyway, so then this guy 
               comes up to me and starts feeling my 
               jacket through his thumb and his forefinger
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               like this.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, what did you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I said: "So, what do you think?". And 
               he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." 
               That was it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wow, just felt your material?

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               point.

               had a baby and I left you a message 
               about it, I would use an exclamation 
               point.

               right now, I would put an exclamation 
               points at the end of all these sentences! 
               On this one! And on that one!

               were hanging on the shower rod. I picked 
               it up, studied it. I thought, I like 
               this. I didn't know what way or what 
               level, but I knew: I wanted to be around 
               brassieres.
