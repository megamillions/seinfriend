<b>                            THE SOUL MATE
</b>


                             Written by

                           Peter Mehlman



<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You want me to find a poem about Susan? 
               May she rest in peace?!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WYCK
</b>               Well, we think it would be a nice touch 
               for the Foundation literature. Do you 
               have a favorite poet, George?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible 
               under his breath.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             WYCK
</b>               Pardon?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (mutters it again)

<b>               
</b><b>                             WYCK
</b>               Well, you should choose the poem since 
               you knew Susan best at the time of her 
               unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George looks at Wyck suspiciously.)

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               New scene - George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He cleared his throat?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He did it right as he said "her unfortunate 
               accident."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not getting it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal 
               implication of doubt - he thinks I killed 
               Susan!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, help me, Rhonda.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What time is it?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b><b>               1:15.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right now?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I gotta go meet Pam.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For 
               once I'd like to be ga-ga.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Where's Elaine?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. 
               You know they all have kids now?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What's with all these people having 
               babies?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Perpetuation of the species.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah! Right!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               By the way, just for the record -

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I did not! (They exit the coffee

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Commercial break.

<b>               
</b>               New scene - Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL

</b><b>                             CAROL

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Uh, it was in the Hamptons.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL

<b>               
</b>               (Elaine is revolted by the sight of "breathtaking" little Adam.)

</b>               New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving 
               Monk's.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, Elaine was telling me about this 
               piece of whitefish she had the other 
               day...
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a 
               meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase 
               with a tape recorder in it. Then after 
               five minutes, he'd come back for it 
               and listen to what everyone said about 
               him.

               "Oh my, yes. They looked like they were eaten away by weavels." 
               The male voice remarks, "It's warm in here. Open a window." Then, 
               "Hey! What are you doing?" The female voice exclaims, "Dear God." 
               There's a clunking sound on the tape, and the recording ends.)

               I'm gonna keep on investigating. This 
               thing is like an onion. The more layers 
               you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, 
               George leaves.)

</b>               There are some people in this room who 
               would have been very happy to never 
               see this briefcase again. There are 
               people in this room who think they can 
               destroy other people's property and 
               get away with it. Well, let me tell 
               you something about those people. They 
               weren't counting on this brain! And 
               this tape recorder.

               all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. 
               A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 
               'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear 
               God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, 
               Wyck.
