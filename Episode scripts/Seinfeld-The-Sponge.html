</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no 
               prescription in the glasses because 
               he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, 
               now why? Why do we think that glasses 
               makes us look more intelligent? Is it 
               from the endless hours of reading and 
               studying and researching that this person 
               supposedly blew out their eyeballs, 
               and that's why they need the glasses? 
               It's just a corrective device. If you 
               see someone with a hearing aid, you 
               don't think, 'Oh, they must have been 
               listening real good...yeah, to a lot 
               of important stuff...' No, they are 
               deaf. They can't hear.

               the counter with a clipboard in his hand)

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't 
               be able to live with myself.
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's hard enough living next door.

</b>               I tell ya, there's some people, they 
               just wear a ribbon and they think they're 
               doin' something? Not me. I talk the 
               talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets 
               up) I'll be right back.
<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's 
               AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on 
               this list.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Lena Small?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for 
               a date, she was unlisted...and now here's 
               her number.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone 
               number off an AIDS charity list!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring 
               to date a giving person.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You're a taking person.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's why I should date a giving person. 
               If I date a taking person, everyone's 
               taking, taking, taking, no one's giving 
               - it's bedlam.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She's gonna ask how you got her number.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who 
               knew her and he gave it to me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I really didn't pay much attention, 
               I'd just come from buying a speedboat.

</b>               See, we're already off the subject of 
               how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) 
               All I gotta do is get past the first 
               phone call and I'm home free.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know about that.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So if Billy had gotten your number off 
               the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have 
               gone out with him?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. 
               How did I get your number? I met a guy 
               that knows you, he gave it to me...I 
               don't remember his name. Think it began 
               with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying 
               that much attention, I'd just come from 
               shopping for a speedboat...

</b>               You know, I really like those new jeans 
               Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the

</b><b>                             LENA
</b>               Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a 
               citation in the mail for my work with 
               shut-ins.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, 
               they're a very eccentric group. Because 
               they're shut in. Of course, they're 
               not locked in, they're free to go at 
               anytime.

               kitchen - they do have cream soups.

               I wanted to talk to you about something...you 
               know, because you're such a good person 
<b>               -

               a sweater, I left the water running. 
               (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, 
               can you get me a towel out of my bedroom 
               closet?
