</b>               So, I'm on line at the supermarket. 
               Two women in front of me. One of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They 
               both

</b><b>               
</b>               of course choose to pay by the use of the (pause and gesture 
               to audience
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for response)

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a 
               woman in front of you that's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed 
               that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               women are very *fast* with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out 
               so many
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't 
               know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never 
               fumble for

</b><b>               
</b>               book from an imaginary holster) ``Who do I make it out to?... 
               There's my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ID...''. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is 
               not masculine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque 
               is like a note
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if you'll
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If 
               you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               just trust me this one time I don't have any money but I have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               these... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?''

               many people work at these big
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               law offices?

</b><b>                             MORTY

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, but if you called up and described 
               someone, do you think they
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               would know who it was?

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I met someone at this party, and 
               I know where she works, but I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               don't know her name.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               So why don't you ask someone who was 
               at the party?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine,
