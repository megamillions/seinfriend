</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, 
               slowest, most despised vehicle on the 
               road. Isn't it? You ever notice when 
               you get behind the bus, people in your 
               car go 'what are you doing? get away, 
               come on.' The back of the bus is like 
               an eclipse isn't it? people are just 
               like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's 
               like this huge metal ass taking up the 
               whole wind shield of your car. When 
               it pulls out it even sounds like a fat 
               uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts 
               like he is trying to get out of a car 
               and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting 
               to get going)

               But I got a big problem. The kid I stand 
               in for, he's growing. He was four feet 
               last month, now he's like four-two and 
               a half. He shot up two and a half inches. 
               I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, 
               any higher than that and I'm gonna be 
               out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.

               been with a guy who was so committed 
               to commit. I mean it's so rare in men 
               these days an, that's what makes this 
               all the more difficult.
