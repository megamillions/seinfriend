<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I have to tell you that I did some very 
               exciting news recently, and I don't 
               know if I should really tell you exactly 
               what it is because it's really not a 
               definite thing yet. Well, I will tell 
               you what I know so far. According to 
               the information that I have in the envelope 
               that I've received, it seems that I 
               may have already won some very valuable 
               prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very 
               much, well thank you. It's very nice 
               to hear that. But, in all honesty, I 
               have to say, I didn't even know I was 
               in this thing. But, according to the 
               readout, it looks like I am among the 
               top people that they are considering. 
               You know, that's what annoys me about 
               the sweepstakes companies, they always 
               tease you with that, "You may have already 
               won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes 
               company to have some guts, come out 
               with the truth, just tell people the 
               truth one time. Send out envelopes, 
               "You have definitely lost!" You turn 
               it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" 
               You open it up, there's this whole letter 
               of explanation, "Even we cannot believe 
               how badly you've done in this contest."

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Since my grandfather died. I was suppose 
               to send it down to my parents in Florida, 
               but they didn't want it. They told me 
               to get rid of it, but I felt funny and 
               then I sort of forgot about it. And 
               it's been sitting down there for three 
               years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) 
               Alright, so, just take what you want 
               and let's get it out of here.
<b>

               get it cleaned.

</b>               When I was ten years old, my parents 
               had this very same statue on the mantle 
               of our apartment. Exactly. And, one 
               day, I grabbed it, and I was using it 
               as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur 
               Park", and I got to the part about, 
               "I'll never have that recipe again," 
               and it slipped out of my hand and it 
               broke. My parents looked at me like 
               I smashed the ten commandments. To this 
               day, they bring it up. It was the single 
               most damaging experience in my life, 
               aside from seeing my father naked.

               your house. You know, you're sitting 
               there on your sofa, and they go by with 
               the vacuum, "I'm really sorry about 
               this. I don't know why I let that stuff 
               over there." And that's why I could 
               never be a maid, because I'd have an 
               attitude. I'd find them, whereever they 
               are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you 
               couldn't do this? No, don't get up, 
               let me clean up your filth. No, you 
               couldn't dust. No, this is too tough,

               It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry

               unlike me.

               has their own little personal security 
               things - things that they think will 
               foil the crooks, you know? In your own 
               mind, right? ..You go to the beach, 
               go in the water, put your wallet in 
               the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What 
               criminal mind could penetrate this fortress 
               of security? I tied a bow. They can't 
               get through that. I put the wallet down 
               by the toe of the sneaker. They never 
               look there. They check the heel, they 
               move on.
