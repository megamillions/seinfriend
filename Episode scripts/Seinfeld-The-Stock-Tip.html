<b>                           THE STOCK TIP
</b>


                             Written by

                    Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld


<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Nightclub)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Went out to dinner the other night. 
               Check came at the end of the meal, as 
               it always does. Never liked the check 
               at the end of the meal system, because
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before 
               you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when 
               you're hungry, you sit down at a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. "More drinks, 
               appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of 
               our lives." Then after the meal, you know,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, 
               cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes 
               at that moment. People are always upset,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you know. They're mystified by the check. "What is this? How 
               could this be?" They start passing it around the table, "Does 
               this look right to you? We're not hungry
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               now. Why are we buying all this food?!"

<b>               
</b><b>                             
</b>               I think Superman probably has a very 
               good sense of humor.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I never heard him say anything really 
               funny.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But it's common sense. He's got super 
               strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's 
               got super humor.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You would think that, but either you're 
               born with a sense of humor, or you're 
               not. It's not going to change even if 
               you go from the red sun of Krypton all
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why? Why would that one area of his 
               mind not be affected by the yellow sun 
               of Earth?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know but he ain't funny.

<b>               
</b>               (Elaine joins them, they check their watches.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No problem.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I dropped a grape.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Pardon?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I dropped a grape in the kitchen and 
               it disappeared. I couldn't find it. 
               I was... I was literally on my knees 
               for ten minutes looking for this stupid 
               grape. I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have no idea where it went.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Were you crying? I mean, it's just a 
               grape. You'll find it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I'm just getting over an allergy 
               attack. This guy I'm going out with 
<b>               -
</b><b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Robert.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two 
               cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, 
               I finally meet a normal man, and I can't 
               even go into his apartment, you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we 
               can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. 
               He won't even go away fro the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               weekend because of these cats.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Guys with cats.. I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I've been thinking about asking this 
               girl I'm, uh, seeing -
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Vanessa.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking 
               about asking her to go away for a couple 
               of days.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to 
               advise against that. What do you know 
               this woman, a month? Let's see, you're 
               going to be with her seventy-two
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hours. That's a dating decathlon.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, 
               why don't you take her to that place 
               in Vermont I was telling you about? 
               You know, that really charming place 
               with
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, 
               uh, if it's not too much trouble, could 
               you pass me that paper over there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Elaine gets the paper, he starts flipping through it.)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You better find that grape before it 
               mutates into another life form. (Elaine 
               laughs) There was once a mutant grape 
               that terrorized an entire town in the 
               Texas
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently 
               it had a pit of steel.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. 
               I'm.. I'm getting it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think the only reason we go to the 
               dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry 
               cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of 
               course, the dry cleaner can respond, 
               "It's not
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That 
               ends our legal obligation." You see, the whole problem with dry 
               cleaning is that we all believe that this
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but 
               they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's 
               gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When 
               you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt 
               and try to get it off like that (brushes
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shirt) - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're 
               doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going (with imaginary 
               brush) "Come on, hurry up! There's a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lot of shirts today."
