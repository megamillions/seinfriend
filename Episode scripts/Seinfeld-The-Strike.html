               miracle!

</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Uh.. that's right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               Welcome, new comers. The tradition of 
               Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. 
               I got a lot of problems with you people! 
               And now you're gonna hear
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
<b>

</b><b>                             FRANK
</b>               (To George) Quiet, you'll get yours 
               in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth 
               a silk sheet if you had a hot date with 
               a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Frank sits down, Jerry gives a face that says "That's a shame". 
               Gwen walks in)

</b>               (Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices 
               Elaine)

</b>               I guess this is the ugly girl I've been 
               hearing about.

               gotta go. I have to work a double shift 
               at H&H.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, I caved. I mean, I really had 
               to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, 
               but this holiday is a little (makes 
               a series of noises) out there.
