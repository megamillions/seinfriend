<b>                         THE STRONG BOX
</b>


                           Written by

                  Dan O'Keefe & Billy Kimball




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George, drinking tea in his apartment with his girlfriend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I-I've given this a lot of thought. 
               I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break 
               up.
<b> 
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               No.

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               We're not breaking up.

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She said no.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               What did you do?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What could I do? We fooled around and 
               went to a movie.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George, both parties don't have to 
               consent to a breakup. It's not like 
               you're launching missiles from a submarine 
               and you both have to turn your keys. 
               Obviously, you didn't make a convincing 
               case. Let me hear your arguments.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I don't really like her.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's good.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't find her attractive.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Solid.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'd like to sleep with a lot of other 
               women.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Always popular.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sometimes at restaurants she talks 
               to her food. 'Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, 
               you are so good.'
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You have an airtight case.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And in bed--

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm afraid we're out of time.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' 
               old cufflinks that he actually wore 
               in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em 
               at an auction.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got some cufflinks I could've loaned 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this 
               Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next 
               week. Now I have an in to strike up 
               a conversation with him.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You already have an in. You have the 
               same first name. Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, that'll intrigue him.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it worked when I met George Peppard 
               last week.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George Peppard has been dead for years.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot 
               about The A-Team.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               based on the method of execution?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Right, right. I mean, if I was getting 
               the chair, I'd go for something hot 
               and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. 
               Lethal injection, feels like pasta. 
               You know, painless, don't want anything 
               to heavy.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               So, um, why don't we get together some 
               time?
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your 
               number?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               I think it'd be better if I called 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch 
               sometime. Do-do you work around here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               Mmmm... no, not really.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, is there anything you can tell 
               me about yourself?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               I think you're very beautiful.

<b>                             ELAINE, LAUGHING
</b>               Oh, ha ha. That'll do.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I haven't talked to him in, like, three 
               weeks. I think it might be over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, what's this guy about?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his 
               phone number, where he worked. I'll 
               be he's in a relationship.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding 
               his secret identity. Elaine, you could 
               be dating the Green Lantern!
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Which one is he?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Green suit, power ring.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't care for jewellery on men.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment carrying a large box.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey. It happened again. Another robbery 
               in the building.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you bought a cooler?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And... what would those be?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Some taxidermy that's been in my family 
               for generations. My Tony, my... military 
               discharge.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You were in the Army?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place 
               to hide this key. Because if somebody 
               finds this, they hold the key to all 
               my possessions.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Literally.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               'Literally'? What's that supposed to 
               mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing 
               here?!
<b> 
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               You told me to meet you here for lunch.
<b>

</b><b>                             MAURA, TO LORETTA
</b>               I'm Maura.

<b>                             LORETTA, TO MAURA

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This is all blowing up in my face! 
               My serious girlfriend, and my
<b> 
</b>               torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined 
               three
<b> 
</b>               lives. Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, 
               so...
<b> 
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               George, what we have is too important. 
               We can work through this.
<b> 
</b><b>                             LORETTA
</b>               So can we.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What? So, this is still not over?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               No.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You?

<b>                             LORETTA
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, 
               so you won't have to burn 'em.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Who is this?

<b>                             ALLISON
</b>               His wife.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You're poor and married?

<b>                             GLENN
</b>               Looks like it.

<b>                             ALLISON
</b>               Who the hell are you?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I guess I'm Lois Loan.

<b>               
</b>               robbers.

               like that on my tombstone.

               God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               All right, then you're the one getting 
               the key out of him.
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried 
               around here. I'm gonna go
<b> 
</b>               check it out.

               (as Jerry starts to dig, Kramer, still in his tux, walks off, 
               trips over a
<b> 
</b>               tombstone, and tries to appear dignified again)

<b>               
</b>               Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               now let's cut him open!

<b>                             'MRS. PHIL'
</b>               Oh!

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, neighbor.

<b>               
</b>               gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each.

<b>                             GEORGE, TO ELAINE
</b>               What do you think?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Give me forty, you'll never see me 
               again.
<b> 
</b>               (Elaine flips her tongue at George, who rolls his eyes away)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE, TO JERRY
</b>               So, what are you gonna do? Are you 
               gonna live here, or are
<b> 
</b>               you gonna move out, or what?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, I'll just take the fire escape 
               to get in and out of the building.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess 
               I forgot to lock it.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You mean it was open? We desecrated 
               a pet cemetery for something?
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, this is one for the books, huh, 
               Jerry? Really one for the books.
