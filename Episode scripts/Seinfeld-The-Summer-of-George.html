<b>                        THE SUMMER OF GEORGE
</b>


                             Written by

                      Alec Berg & Jeff Schaffer




<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (George and Jerry at a cafe terrace)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, you had a good run. Took them to 
               the World Series.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got to give the players most of the 
               credit for that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Don't sell yourself short. You made 
               all the flight arrangements, hotels, 
               buses.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, I don't know who was doing that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, when you actually did work, what 
               it was that you did?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They had a pastry cart you wouldn't 
               believe.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Waitress (Lanette) comes with drinks)

<b>               
</b><b>                             LANETTE
</b>               Here you go. Your latte, your cappuccino.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Waitress leaves)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe I should ask her out?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She is a good waitress.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's true. Maybe I take her to the 
               Tony's.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You're going to the Tony's?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show 
               and they gave me two tickets.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why didn't you ask me? I know a million 
               theater jokes. 'What's the deal with 
               those guys down in the pit?'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They're musicians. That's not a joke.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's a funny observation.

<b>               
</b>               (George reads a letter)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Severance package...The Yankees are 
               giving me three months full pay for 
               doing nothing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They did it for three years. What's 
               another few months.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm really going to do something with 
               these three months.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Like what?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm gonna read a book. From beginning 
               to end. In that order.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I've always wanted to do that...

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm gonna play frolf.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You mean golf?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with 
               a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. 
               Time to taste the fruits and let the 
               juices drip down my chin. I proclaim 
               this: The Summer
<b> 
</b>               of George!

<b>

               the two of us, working together at full
