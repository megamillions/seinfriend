          had a little thing with her for
          a while.

          lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little
          red convertible (top down), distracted
          with
<b>          
</b>          disappointment/sadness. He parks
          behind Jerry's car and bumps it.
          Jerry's trunk has unlatched but
          not popped open big.
<b>          
</b>          PETERMAN doesn't notice anything
          and goes in. Shortly after he passes,
          MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting
          in the

          shuts the trunk.

          sign (with stick-in white letters):

          The Pinstripe Ball is starting.
          The walls there are mahogany, and
          there are short, decorative
<b>          
</b>          columns with flowers on top of
          them. Everyone is in tuxedos and
          gowns, and the music is mellow
          and quiet. GEORGE is
<b>          
</b>          waiting in a tux for Allison, but
          KRAMER arrives in his rather tight
          tux. They talk quietly.]

          tough nut.
<b>          
</b>          How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's
          a rental but I've had it for fifteen
          years.

          KRAMER's trying to just walk by,
          and GEORGE is trying to restrain
          him without attracting too

</b>          [GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly
          spinning hold--by holding the back
          of KRAMER's tux--but the material
          tore away, and
<b>          
</b>          this sent KRAMER spinning into
          the room with the back torn off
          his tux! Strangely, this is well-received
          by WILHELM!]
