               before he was turned down by another 
               bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's 
               Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. 
               That was the third bank to turn him 
               down so I was-I was a little concerned. 
               I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, 
               Your Honor, he was barely audible. But

</b>               Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna 
               make the pilot.

</b><b>                             NEWMAN
</b>               Pilot? So what do you make for something 
               like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think you're getting a ticket.
