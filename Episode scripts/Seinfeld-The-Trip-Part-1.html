</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Murphy Brown, the TV show.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               C'mon, will ya?

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I know!

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've always liked her. Remember her 
               in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sure.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Did she show her breasts in that?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's not really the naked type.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't believe I missed Kramer. You 
               know he asked me to go with him
<b> 
</b>               to California.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He did?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, I turned him down.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How come you didn't tell me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He asked me to keep it a secret.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But you can never keep a secret.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know. This was like a record. My previous 
               record was when Joni
<b> 
</b>               Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept 
               a lid on that
<b> 
</b>               for about 28 seconds.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, you've come a long way.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I've matured.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey listen, the Tonight Show called 
               me, they want me to come out and do
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to 
               LA. You wanna
<b> 
</b>               go?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               A free ticket?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. 
               I always felt bad about the
<b> 
</b>               way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken 
               back those
<b> 
</b>               keys.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What about accommodations?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All taken care of.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is there a meal allowance? What about 
               seat assignments? Could I have
<b> 
</b>               the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. 
               Gotta
<b> 
</b>               get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. 
               Oh, do I
<b> 
</b>               need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal 
               tour? They have
<b> 
</b>               that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So my acting technique, my personal 
               acting technique is working with
<b> 
</b>               color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational 
               mood connected to
<b> 
</b>               the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that 
               all my lines
<b> 
</b>               have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize 
               color. This way
<b> 
</b>               I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full 
               palette of
<b> 
</b>               emotions.

</b>               It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy 
               Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I called it.

<b>               
</b>               Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America 
               are the people
<b> 
</b>               that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't 
               you hate
<b> 
</b>               these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, 
               look out, cart
<b> 
</b>               people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless 
               peasants. Oooh!
<b> 
</b>               It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the 
               cart people,
<b> 
</b>               Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're 
               too fat, slow
<b> 
</b>               and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready 
               for air travel.
<b> 
</b>               The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving 
               walkway and
<b> 
</b>               then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no 
               animated
<b> 
</b>               pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing 
               about Eva Braun,
<b> 
</b>               only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the 
               table collapses.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally 
               like this, usually I'm very
<b> 
</b>               cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but 
               I think it's fate
<b> 
</b>               that you happened to be here at the same time as me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRED
</b>               Yeah, its fate,

               you know, can't avoid your fate.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               be great in.

</b><b>                             FRED

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               So I'd like to give it to you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             FRED

</b>               Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves,

<b>               
</b>               As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into 
               his car and drives
<b> 
</b>               off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office 
               notices this
<b> 
</b>               and picks up one of the photos.

</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               Really.

<b>               
</b>               Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               ...so mind you, at this point I'm only 
               going out with her two or three
<b> 
</b>               weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. 
               So at this
<b> 
</b>               time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it 
               slips my mind for a
<b> 
</b>               few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it's the damnedest thing. The 
               cat dies. So she comes back into
<b> 
</b>               town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               So you killed the cat.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's what she says. I say, listen. 
               It was an old cat. It died of
<b> 
</b>               natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy 
               her a brand new
<b> 
</b>               cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. 
               I'm not
<b> 
</b>               gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And 
               second of all, I
<b> 
</b>               go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. 
               I say, you show
<b> 
</b>               me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I 
               spring for a new
<b> 
</b>               cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the 
               hell out of here,
<b> 
</b>               and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be 
               a great case on
<b> 
</b>               L.A. Law?

<b>               
</b>               Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Really? Because people do meet in places

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE WENDT

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE WENDT
</b>               Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers,

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               How's it going?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Great! Great! I actually just had two 
               meaningful intelligent
<b> 
</b>               conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Really?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you 
               know? Actual conversation, I was
<b> 
</b>               incredibly articulate!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You got toilet paper on your heel there.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George looks down, Jerry walks away.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ANNOUNCER
</b>               It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. 
               Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin
<b> 
</b>               Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.

<b>               
</b>               Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming 
               up to me trying to give
<b> 
</b>               me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, 
               right outside
<b> 
</b>               in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says 
               he's supposed to
<b> 
</b>               watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he 
               forgets to feed
<b> 
</b>               the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses 
               to get her a
<b> 
</b>               new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants 
               Arnie Becker to
<b> 
</b>               represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for 
               L.A. Law.
<b> 
</b>               Thanks a lot.

<b>               
</b>               Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELENA
</b>               He's a very handsome man. Passionate, 
               intense, but troubled, strange.
<b> 
</b>               I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing 
               abnormal about
<b> 
</b>               that, I have many suitors.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE WENDT
</b>               It's funny, 'cause even after all these 
               years, we still get
<b> 
</b>               people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a 
               few moments ago I
<b> 
</b>               ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should 
               think about,
<b> 
</b>               you know, not doing the show in a bar.

<b>               
</b>               Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing 
               besides George.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van 
               Kramer hitched a
<b> 
</b>               ride to LA in (see "The Keys") known only as 'The Freak' is being 
               questioned by
<b> 
</b>               the Lt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             THE FREAK
</b>               So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, 
               dude. You ever killed a man
<b> 
</b>               before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands 
               have been
<b> 
</b>               soaking in Ivory liquid?

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt 
               are talking
<b> 
</b>               between takes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE WENDT
</b>               The guy you talked to, what did he look 
               like?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               Short little bald guy with glasses.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE WENDT
</b>               Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked 
               to.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CORBIN BERNSEN
</b>               It never ends, does it?

<b>               
</b>               Cut to Jerry, on stage, doing his routine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So I'm going through the airport and 
               I have to put my bag on that little
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.

<b>               
</b>               Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.

<b>               
</b>               Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             LT. MARTEL
</b>               Issue an arrest warrant, put out an 
               APB. Let's pick up this, uh,
<b> 
</b>               Kramer.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set,

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I was terrible.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What are you, crazy? You were fine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't 
               remember what I was trying to
<b> 
</b>               say, that whole thing about the, uh...

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Conveyor belt.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.

<b>               
</b>               George and Jerry walk past a TV and stop as a special report 
               is being broadcast.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             TV NEWSCASTER
</b>               Our top story tonight, there has been 
               a break in the so called
<b> 
</b>               'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the 
               suspect being
<b> 
</b>               sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George and Jerry stare at each other in disbelief.

</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is 
               left in the show.
<b> 
</b>               You know, they're always looking off camera, "Do we have time? 
               Are we out of
<b> 
</b>               time? How we doin' on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's 
               the time?
<b> 
</b>               Check the time?" You never see Magnum P.I. go, "Should I strangle 
               this guy or
<b> 
</b>               are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? 
               I'll tell
<b> 
</b>               you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll 
               come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us."
