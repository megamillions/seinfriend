<b>               
</b>               There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that 
               the chalk outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can 
               get. You know it's not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, 
               that seems like a good one. I don't know who they are, I guess 
               they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't 
               draw too well..."listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you 
               think if we left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you 
               could manage to trace around it? Could you do that?". I don't 
               even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look 
               at the thing on the ground..."aah his arm was like that when 
               he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim."

               to drive, you're getting us both killed!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What are we supposed to do? What do 
               you do on a situation like this? Should 
               we call a lawyer, should we call the 
               police?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Obviously we're gonna call the police 
               and tell that he's not the guy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               The three hour time difference threw 
               me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they 
               wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, 
               because they were only serving breakfast.

               right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. 
               You just couldn't help yourself, could 
               you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly

               of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love 
               you enough, maybe the teacher didn't 
               call on you in school when you had your 
               little hand raised, maybe the pervert 
               in the park had a present in his pants, 
               huh? Well, I've got another theory Kramer:

</b>               Authorities exposed today, that the 
               latest suspect in the smog strangling 
               was apprehended this week on an unrelated 
               charge, but somehow managed to escape 
               from the police car, in which he was 
               being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who 
               is also wanted in connection with a 
               series of unrelated slains in the North 
               West is still at large, his whereabouts 
               unknown. He's described as 5'5" bald 
               and reputedly a very generous tipper.

</b>               The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they 
               have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend 
               that people stay indoors during the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm 
               way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air 
               in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where 
               the house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar 
               with couple of holes punched in the top? What the hell is going 
               on out there? It's very strange, do you realize that it's now 
               possible for parents to say to their children "All right kids, 
               I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, 
               everybody indoors."
