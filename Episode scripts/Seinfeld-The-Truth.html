               would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide 
               (small fingers opening
               imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT 
               hard to get round black
               buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like 
               this? ... is it such a
               great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, 
               you'll never find them - they
               save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know 
               they're going to fall off too, that's the other thing ...

</b>               Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because 
               when you have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments

</b>               (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) 
               There's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when 
               I'm naked. Cause I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging 
               and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that 
               would be,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able 
               to do this (hand
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.

</b>               I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds 
               like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun
               about it, you know. 
<b>               
</b>               But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything 
               to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take
               all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake
               and just kinda crank it around there.

               You know give me a feeling like you might win something. 
               You know what I               
               mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm 
               sorry that's           
               another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting 
               gifts for you. Jail!"
