</b>               (To himself) Now what am I supposed 
               to do here? Shall I go over there? It's 
               not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" 
               for god's sake. If she was sitting next 
               to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't 
               be making a big move like going all 
               the way over there. I can't. I won't.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She calls me this morning and tells 
               me she's upset I didn't console her. 
               I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. 
               What, what do you do in a situation 
               like that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I was sitting on the chair. She was 
               over here on the couch.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well you know, if you were sitting right 
               next to her you'd have to console her 
               no matter what.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Of course.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               When you're talking about a movie like 
               "Beaches", moving from the chair to 
               the couch ... that's quite a voyage.
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               have to avoid going back stage and having 
               to think of something to say.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Going backstage is the worst. Especially 
               when they stink. You know that's a real 
               problem.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Just once I would like to tell someone 
               they stink. You know what? I doidn't 
               like the show. I didn't like you. It 
               just really stunk. The whole thing...real 
               bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets 
               though.

               Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. 
               Broadway has no room for people like 
               you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway 
               takes people like you and eats them 
               up and spits them out. My Broadway is 
               the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, 
               and Fontaine, and if you think you can 
               build yourself up by knocking other 
               people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
