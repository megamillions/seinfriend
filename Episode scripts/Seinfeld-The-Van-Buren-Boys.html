               you punch in your age, and all your 
               risk factors. It actually counts down 
               how much time you have left to live.

</b>               So what's the great moment? You're on 
               your death bed, they're pounding on 
               your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 
               8,.. I told you this thing was good!
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELLEN

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELLEN
</b>               I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELLEN

</b><b>                             ELLEN
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               (Waiters come out with a cake, singing "Happy Birthday" to a 
               woman named "Lisa" at another table. Jerry ponders why Ellen 
               isn't celebrating with her friends)

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. And she picked the day!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Is she socially awkward?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, she's great! She's.. attractive, 
               she's fun..

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, maybe she decided to celebrate 
               her birthday on the Monday after the 
               weekend.
