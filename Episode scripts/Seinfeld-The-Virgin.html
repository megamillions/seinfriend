</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We're not dead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We are dead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Come on. We got all day tomorrow to 
               come up with a story.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All day tomorrow? We had a month and 
               a half to come up with something and 
               we didn't do anything.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So we'll do it tomorrow.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Let me ask you something. When's the 
               last time you went skiing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               About six years ago.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think you can take the lift ticket 
               off your jacket now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Women like skiers.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what? You can't meet anybody. You're 
               going on with Susan.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. Right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, see those two women over there? 
               I almost dated the one on the right. 
               She's in the closet business.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               The closet business? What's the closet 
               business?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What is it your business?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm interested.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She reorganizes your closet and shows 
               you how to maximize your closet space. 
               She looked into my closet.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you thought she was good looking 
               and figured this would be a good way 
               to meet her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. So what happened?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend 
               and then it hit me. What do I need more 
               closet space for? (Across the room) 
               Hi, Marla.

<b> 
</b><b>

               watching it on CNN, and they covered 
               it so well I thought, "Why knock my 
               brains out?"

               ago and they gave us the green light 
               to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, 
               we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. 
               They gotta approve of the story before 
               we can write.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a 
               lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly 
               easy to me. Some people write symphonies. 
               This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Would you believe my luck? The first

               to the question, "What do you do?" and 
               I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't 
               need a girlfriend when you can answer 
               that question. That's what you say in 
               order to get girlfriends. Once you can 
               get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, 
               you just want more girlfriends.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The script, the pilot, the TV show.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Figure it out. She's one of the executives 
               at NBC that's gonna make the decision 
               whether or not they pick up the show. 
               She's one of our biggest fans. You drop 
               her off, you think they're gonna pick 
               us up?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               you know, it's a very interesting situation. 
               Here you have a job that can get you 
               girls. But, you also have a relationship. 
               But if you try and get rid of the relationship 
               so you can get the girls, you lose the 
               job. You see the irony?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. 
               What about this? What if I can find 
               some way to break up with her so that 
               she'll still like me and it doesn't 
               affect the deal.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss 
               this. You're very quick to dismiss. 
               Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush 
               on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. 
               She talks about him all the time. Suppose 
               I go up to David Letterman. He works 
               at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my 
               situation. He agrees to meet her. They 
               go out, they fall madly in love. And 
               she dumps me for David Letterman.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             MARLA
</b>               Because I have a very radical idea.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Try me.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARLA
</b>               Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate 
               all this. The hangers, the bar, the 
               shelves. And in its place install a 
               series of hooks. We'll put everything 
               on hooks.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             MARLA
</b>               Everything. The shirts, pants, sport 
               jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty 
               hooks on here.

               on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying 
               out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! 
               Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's 
               just lying there. So then, this woman, 
               the one who sold me this hair thing, 
               she grabbed it before the guy noticed, 
               so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry 
               around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, 
               like it's a big, big secret that women 
               carry around their diaphragms. You never 
               know when you're gonna need it, right? 
               (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.

               I mean, something happens to their personality 
               it's really quite astounding. It's like 
               they committed a crime and they want

               and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. 
               Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, 
               we got nothing. You're not even in show 
               business. I gotta reputation. You drag 
               me into the sewer with you. I've been 
               on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word

               waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? 
               Well, we thought it would be very funny 
               to do an entire show where all you're 
               doin' is waitin' for the table. (They 
               don't seem to like it) Because we've 
               all been in that situation. You know, 
               you're waiting... and you're hungry... 
               and you bump into somebody you know... 
               When is Russell coming back?

               an accident with a guy who has no insurance 
               and the judge sentences him to be my 
               butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he 
               cooks for me, he has to cook for me... 
               He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, 
               you know? I'm walkin' around with one 
               of those big neck collars.

</b><b>                             MARLA
</b>               Well Elaine said men like to leave after 
               it's over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock 
               into what Elaine has to say about relationships. 
               She comes from a broken home, and I 
               mean that literally. A tree fell on 
               her roof and cracked the whole structure. 
               Her parents got along beautifully, but 
               her house was in bad shape.

</b><b>                             MARLA

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight 
               dope.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               More like a dope was giving it to her 
               straight. Another cup of coffee with 
               you, she'll wind up in a convent.

               told her, believe me.

               what? I got served with papers today. 
               Ping is suing me. I need your virgin 
               as a witness. You better be nice to

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited

               she learned her father's a homosexual, 
               and she got fired from a high paying 
               network job. Yeah, they had a real good
