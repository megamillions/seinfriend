</b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person 
               that knows the
<b> 
</b>               rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the 
               game, moving our
<b> 
</b>               pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer 
               is the only person
<b> 
</b>               that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of 
               the fun things
<b> 
</b>               for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, your 
               Honor."
<b> 
</b>               Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." To 
               which the judge
<b> 
</b>               can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult 
               version of "Fraid
<b> 
</b>               so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version 
               of "Duh."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               First scene.

               George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental 
               woman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases 
               do you handle?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHERYL
</b>               Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration 
               and naturalization.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What is that, immigrants come over, 
               you show them how to act natural?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHERYL
</b>               Are your friends as funny as you?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, they're not funny at all. No, I 
               have no funny friends. I'm the
<b> 
</b>               funny one. El Clowno.

<b>               
</b>               Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Look, I was nice enough to pick it up 
               for you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, I've been back four days, I want 
               my mail.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It's mostly bills, magazines and junk 
               mail anyway.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Elaine, that's what mail is. Without 
               bills, magazines and junk mail,
<b> 
</b>               there is no mail.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CHERYL
</b>               Here's my card.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking 
               to you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CHERYL
</b>               Nice meeting you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b>               Cheryl leaves, George walks over to the booth to meet Jerry and 
               Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hi!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, how ya doin?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You would not believe what just happened. 
               I was waiting for you and
<b> 
</b>               this woman was sitting at the counter.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What, the one who just left?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, 
               and she's this lawyer who's
<b> 
</b>               incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed 
               at everything I
<b> 
</b>               said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost 
               too good. I
<b> 
</b>               started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? 
               I got no place to
<b> 
</b>               go.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.

<b> 
</b>               never thank you enough for everything you do.

<b>               
</b>               Cut back to George and Elaine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You see, this is what I do with women. 
               I start out too strong, now I
<b> 
</b>               have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good 
               is real? They
<b> 
</b>               don't want real, they want funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No they don't.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta 
               give them a big show. You
<b> 
</b>               always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd

<b>

</b>               Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole 
               life is a fantasy camp.
<b> 
</b>               People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him 
               for a week. Do
<b> 
</b>               nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors 
               and have
<b> 
</b>               sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.

<b> 
</b>               dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with 
               her if you want,
<b> 
</b>               you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.

<b>               
</b>               George has a dream sequence where the four of them are at a dinner 
               table and
<b> 
</b>               Cheryl is laughing hysterically at one of Jerry's jokes.

<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But

<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe you don't have to be so funny. 
               I mean, would it kill you not to
<b> 
</b>               be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks 
               I'm very
<b> 
</b>               funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm 
               gonna be a short
<b> 
</b>               bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hello. Welcome back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CHERYL
</b>               Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and 
               she makes such a big deal about
<b> 
</b>               it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, birthdays are merely symbolic 
               of how another year has gone by and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday 
               a better
<b> 
</b>               self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, 
               we know it's not
<b> 
</b>               to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, 
               this is who we are
<b> 
</b>               to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No 
               such thing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, I punched him and they took him 
               to the hospital and then they
<b> 
</b>               canceled the rest of the week.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You punched who in the mouth?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, you know, we were playing a game 
               and, you know, I was pitching,
<b> 
</b>               and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was 
               up, and man that
<b> 
</b>               guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wow! Joe Pepitone!

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own 
               the inside of that plate. So I
<b> 
</b>               throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put 
               him right on his
<b> 
</b>               pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the 
               next pitch,
<b> 
</b>               he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You plunked him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, 
               he comes racing up to the
<b> 
</b>               mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha 
               breaks out
<b> 
</b>               between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, 
               and as I'm
<b> 
</b>               trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, 
               somebody pulls
<b> 
</b>               me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. 
               I looked down,
<b> 
</b>               and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Wow, this is incredible!

<b>               
</b>               A voice is heard from the hallway.

<b>               
</b><b>                             BABU
</b>               Leave me alone! You can't do this to

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's going on out there?

<b>               
</b><b>                             BABU

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa 
               was expired. Poor Babu,
<b> 
</b>               everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he 
               had a job. What
<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             BABU
