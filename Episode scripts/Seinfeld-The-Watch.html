<b>                             THE WATCH
</b>


                             Written by

                            Larry David

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's an entire industry of bad gifts, 
               aren't they? All those
<b> 
</b>               executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put 
               a piece of green
<b> 
</b>               felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, 
               dad." But to
<b> 
</b>               me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's 
               no better
<b> 
</b>               way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse 
               to put any thought
<b> 
</b>               into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers 
               are just
<b> 
</b>               blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed 
               to the back of
<b> 
</b>               a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are 
               they
<b> 
</b>               typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need 
               a paperweight for?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Restaurant)

<b>               
</b>               Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld and uncle Leo are having dinner.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               (to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, 
               Jimmy Sherman.
<b> 
</b>               (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week 
               to fix. He fixed
<b> 
</b>               yours in one day.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, you know these jewellers, they're 
               enigmas. They're
<b> 
</b>               mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.

<b>               
</b>               Morty sits, brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Helen watches her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               (indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's okay.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Just okay?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's nice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               She's better than nice.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's all right.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               She's beautiful.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's not beautiful.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I think she's beautiful.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you ask her out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I'm not gonna ask her out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why not?

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               If you don't think she's beautiful, 
               there's something wrong with
<b> 
</b>               you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think that's a little extreme.

<b>               
</b><b>                             LEO
</b>               (grudgingly) She's awright.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               (oblivious to the above) Two exact same 
               watches. He tells you a
<b> 
</b>               week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about 
               this.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He said what?

</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               Those were his exact words.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (worried) Oh boy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               He said, "We've got five hundred shows

<b> 
</b>               should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience,

</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               (tossing her purse on the dash) I told

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               nothing to do with this.
<b> 
</b>               It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the 
               creative
<b> 
</b>               guy. He handles the business end.

<b>               
</b><b>                             SUSAN
</b>               You said it was insulting.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? 
               I'm never insulted.
<b> 
</b>               You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults 
               me.
<b>

</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               How can they just cancel
<b> 
</b>               the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy?

</b><b>                             SUSAN

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (handing over the phone) You're not

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Kramer holds on. He begins to sing along with the hold music.

</b><b>               
</b>               He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine, who gives a 'what the hell

<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>

</b>               we're much more than friends...

<b>               
</b>               Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep 
               going.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b>               Elaine smiles.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               ...and uh, she's very much in love with

</b>               would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow 
               us to pursue
<b> 
</b>               our courtship unfettered.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks extremely pleased, she gives Kramer okay gestures.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               If not, I can assure you, doctor, that 
               I can make things very
<b> 
</b>               unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.

<b>               
</b>               Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate 
               he's
<b> 
</b>               doing so well.

<b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine's smile begins to look a bit stiff.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               ...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh,

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Elaine's face starts to look a bit sick.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (listens) ...Well, I suppose I could,

</b>               but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for 
               a second, will

</b>               you? Uh...

<b>               
</b>               Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad, he puts it on 
               his knee.
<b> 
</b>               Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

               Eh, hah, okay. So
<b> 
</b>               long.

<b>               
</b>               Kramer hangs up the phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

               box of
<b>

               to put
<b> 
</b>               out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for 
               it, he keeps
<b> 
</b>               the rest of the tissue in his hand, where it burns his fingers. 
               He jumps, almost
<b> 
</b>               dropping his cigar, and sucks at his burned digits.

</b>               Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers

<b>               
</b>               Everyone begins to head for the door.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               You're a terrific kid.

<b>               
</b>               Jerry picks up a case.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b>               George picks up the other case, as Morty and Helen exit.

<b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               How could anybody not like you?

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b>               Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and

<b> 
</b>               toward the driver's door. He stops, as something catches his 
               eye. Leo picks the
<b> 
</b>               wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching, 
               and tucks it
<b> 
</b>               into his pocket as he goes to get in the car.
