<b>                              THE WIFE
</b>


                             Written by

</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               (Comedy club)

<b>               
</b>               Of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning 
               relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving 
               each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. 
               He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. 
               It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as 
               you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think 
               of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The 
               only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' 
               Y'know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings 
               - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' 
               But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean 
               only! Are you crazy?!'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Opening scene - Jerry and his girlfriend Meryl at Jerry's apartment. 
               Meryl comes out of Jerry's bedroom.

</b>               Good morning.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Good morning.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               How'd you sleep?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, you are the couch tonight, young 
               lady. You were all over my side.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek 
               off the bed!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               By the way, you're falling way behind 
               on the 'I love you's.'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, no, 12-8!

<b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               No, it's 15-8.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying 
               to stay competitive.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll 
               try a sport jacket and scarf thing, 
               you know, like an unemployed actor. 
               (Goes into his room, and comes back 
               out with the jacket on.) Haven't worn 
               this one in a long time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               Ooh, cashmere?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his 
               pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. 
               What the hell is this? There's a picture 
               in here, look at that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               Wow, this is really old. You don't know 
               whose it is?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I haven't worn this jacket since 
               I got it back from the dry-cleaner. 
               Maybe we should ask him.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               Alright, we'll stop over there.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               Pancakes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting 
               pancakes.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But we can't both get pancakes, it's 
               embarrassing. It's like one step from 
               the couples who dress alike.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MERYL
</b>               I'll get the short stack.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They 
               go out into the hallway and run into 
               Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, 
               Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, is that my maple syrup? (Kramer

               enjoying this marriage thing. You think 
               about each other. You care about each 
               other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love 
               saying "my wife." Once I started saying 
               it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, 
               "my wife" that...it's an amazing way 
               to begin a sentence.

</b>               Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush

               the other night? I was cold. So, last 
               night, I turn up the heat - it's too 
               hot. I open up a window - it's too cold.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the

               water!
<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>
