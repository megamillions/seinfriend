</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I really like the wig historically. 
               I guess the revolutionary war, the last 
               war fought in wig, and it seems that 
               it must have been hard. You know they're 
               going in to battle, they think.. well 
               do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby 
               pins.. and you got to make sure you 
               have everything... lot more to worry 
               about What if I get killed.? Is my wig 
               on straight? I don't know when the whole 
               wig thing came in to style for men... 
               but I know when it went out.! When the 
               mirror was invented. No guy is looking 
               in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair 
               on his head going ..All right! lets 
               go rap to the ladies..

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm looking for a crested blazer

<b>               
</b><b>                             CRAIG
</b>               A crested blazer..

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I've worn one once and I really think 
               it did something for me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CRAIG 
</b>               (turning around): Yes .I Think we may 
               have something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest....
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world 
               famous
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CRAIG
</b>               It looks fabulous on you... shall I 
               wrap it up?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you 
               what. I'll come back later with someone 
               and see what they think.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             CRAIG
</b>               (doubtful) A Hum!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Really I'll be back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CRAIG
</b>               Yeah!

<b>               
</b>               Cuts to Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b>               George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and 
               Jerry are talking.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So I didn't like the crest all that 
               much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes 
               with me so to get out of the store I 
               told I wanted to see what someone else 
               thought.... And then he makes a face 
               like he doesn't believe me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah! So he knew that you were making 
               it up!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah..... He caught me. So here's what 
               I want you to do. Come back with me 
               to the store and we'll pretend to look 
               at the coat.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That's ridiculous. Why do do you want 
               to go back there if you don't want the 
               coat?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because he thinks I was lying and I 
               want to show him I wasn't.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               But you were!!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But if you go back with me, then I'm 
               not.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE

               Whatever

</b><b>               
</b>               and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with 
               the walking stick and puts it on.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat/hat/stick looking 
               very much like a stereotype pimp.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac
