</b>               (Elaine's bedroom - phone rings)

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hello.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JAMES

</b>               A woman with a sexy voice like yours 
               its hard to believe you're waking up alone.
<b>

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>

</b><b>                             JAMES
</b>               Call me James.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Your wake up guy asked you out?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel 
               like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. 
               I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing 
               my nightie,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know. Blind date?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? You're going to go out with my 
               cousin Holly. You've never met her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               At least I've spoken to my guy. You're 
               going out on a deaf date.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think I'd rather go out on a deaf 
               date than a blind date. The question 
               is whether you'd rather date the blind 
               or the deaf.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Ah. . .

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Now you're off on a topic.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, I think, I would rather date 
               the deaf.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Uh hu.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because I think the blind would probably 
               be a little messier around the house. 
               And lets face it they're not going to 
               get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be 
               walking around with a sponge.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating 
               the blind. You know you could let the 
               house go. You could let yourself go. 
               A good looking blind woman doesn't even 
               know you're not good enough for her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I think she'd figure it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? What is this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What 
               are you turning into?

</b>               (rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted

</b>               Twenty-five percent, you say? No way!

               to kidnap that other dog. These muts 
               like to gossip. So have you talked too
