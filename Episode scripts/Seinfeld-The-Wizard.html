</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Keep it real!

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Let's get nuts!

               China is an instant page-turner?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's a Wizard electronic organizer 
               for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida
<b> 
</b>               for his birthday.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               How much was it?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's 
               fifty. He doesn't care about the
<b> 
</b>               gift. He gets excited about the deal.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Where are you gettin' a Wizard for 
               fifty dollars?
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, 
               and maybe it's hot. That's
<b> 
</b>               his favorite.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got a message from the Rosses at 
               work today.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Susan's parents? When's the last time 
               you talked to them?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               At the funeral, give or take. You know, 
               deep down, I always kinda
<b> 
</b>               felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why, because you picked out the poision 
               envelopes? That's silly.
<b> 
</b>               people I know. Jerry, George.

<b>                             DARRYL
</b>               Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, 
               Elaine. I'll see you later.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b><b>               OK.
</b>
<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Still no Puddy?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Uh, I think his answering machine's 
               broken, so I just gave up. Well,
<b> 
</b>               what do you think?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               What? About you datin' a black guy? 
               What's the big deal?
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What black guy?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Darryl. He's black, isn't he?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He is?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, he isn't.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Isn't he, Elaine?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You think?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I thought he looked Irish.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's his last name?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Nelson.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's not Irish.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think he's black.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Should we be talkin' about this?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I think it's OK.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, it isn't.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why not?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it would be OK if Darryl was 
               here.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If he's black.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Is he black?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Does it matter?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, course not. I mean, I'd just like 
               to know.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, so you need to know?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I don't need to know. I just think 
               it would be nice if I knew.
<b> 
</b><b>                             WAITRESS
</b>               Should I take that?

               (when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly 
               get out lots
<b> 
</b>               of money for her tip)

<b>               
</b>               George.

<b>                             MRS. ROSS
</b>               Uh, who?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? 
               Long time no speak.
<b> 
</b>               woman to buy more.

<b>                             MRS. ROSS
</b>               Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation 
               is having an event this
<b> 
</b>               weekend.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out 
               in the Hamptons, and I have got
<b> 
</b>               to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.

<b>                             MRS. ROSS
</b>               Thank you for calling, George.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were 
               almost my, uh... OK, I gotta
<b> 
</b>               go.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               House in the Hamptons?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, you know, I've been lyin' about 
               my income for a few years. I
<b> 
</b>               figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's

<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>                             KRAMER

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so 
               optioned it for a movie.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>                             JERRY

<b>                             KRAMER

</b>               Yeah, and you're not going to, because 
               I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm
<b>

</b>               You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's

<b>                             MORTY

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, I got it from a guy on the street.

<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER, IMMATURELY

<b>                             KRAMER

<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               You're black. You said we were an interracial 
               couple.
<b> 
</b><b>                             DARRYL
</b>               We are. Because you're Hispanic.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I am?

<b>                             DARRYL
</b>               Aren't you?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No. Why would you think that?

<b>                             DARRYL
</b>               Your name's Benes, your hair, and you 
               kept taking me to those
<b> 
</b>               Spanish restaurants.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               That's because I thought you were black.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             DARRYL
</b>               Why would you take me to a Spanish 
               restaurant because I'm black?
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't think we should be talking 
               about this.
<b> 
</b><b>                             DARRYL
</b>               So, what are you?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I'm white.

<b>                             DARRYL
</b>               So, we're just a couple of white people?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I guess.

<b>                             DARRYL
</b>               Oh.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
<b> 
</b><b>

<b> 
</b><b>                             MORTY

<b>                             OLD MAN
</b>               It's overtipping. I just left five

<b> 
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.

<b>                             MORTY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Because a real Wizard's two hundred

<b> 
</b><b>                             MORTY
