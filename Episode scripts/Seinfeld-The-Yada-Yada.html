<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MARCY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I was naked.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARCY
</b>               Oh, George.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I saw it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARCY
</b>               How'd he look?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Okay. I wouldn't see it again.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARCY
</b>               You know, a friend of mine thought she 
               got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             MARCY
</b>               Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg

               up)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, "yada yada" is good. She's very 
               succinct.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She is succinct.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today.

</b><b>                             MR. ABBOTT
</b>               That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley 
               was one of my students. And if this 
               wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock 
               you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard.

</b>               Oh, I said something about dentists 
               and it got blown all out of proportion.

</b>               Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails 
               out of med school?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's a good one. Dentists.

</b><b>                             BETH
</b>               Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention 
               the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes
